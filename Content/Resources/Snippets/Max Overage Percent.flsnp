        The remainder of fulfillment needed to fulfill the prepack configuration (between 0 and 100%). 
        <p>To allocate a prepack with a 10% overage, it means that 90% of the prepack needs to be filled. At maximum, 10% has yet to be filled.</p><p>If there is a prepack of 10, the maximum overage would be defined as follows:</p><ul><li>If there is a need of 9, the unfulfilled unit would mean that there needs to be a maximum overage of 10% set in order for the prepack to be fulfilled.</li><li>If there is a need of 8, the unfulfilled 2 units would mean that there needs to be a maximum overage of 20% in order for the prepack to be fulfilled.</li><li>If there is a need of 5, the unfulfilled 5 units would mean that there needs to be a maximum overage of 50% in order for the prepack to be fulfilled.</li></ul><p>Hence, if [Units not fulfilled/Total pack] &gt; Overage threshold, it won’t work.</p><p>For example, </p><ul><li>For a total need of 4 (so sending pack of 5 creates 1 unit of overage) - <span class="Emphasis">This means the max overage % needs to be set to at least 20% in order for fulfillment.</span></li><li>3 units of demand, therefore 2 of overage if prepack is sent - <span class="Emphasis">This means that the overage % needs to be set to at least 40% for fulfillment.</span></li><li>2 units of demand, therefore 3 of overage if prepack is sent. As 3/5 is over allowed tolerance % then it would not be sent - <span class="Emphasis">This means that the max overage % needs to be set to at least 60% for fulfillment.</span></li></ul><p>If there is an Overage Threshold at 41%, this means that [1 - Overage Threshold] needs to be fulfilled already.</p><p>1 - 0.41 = 0.59 needs to be fulfilled (right under 3 units to be allocated before the remainder of the pack is allocated). </p><ul><li><p>For 4 or even 3 demand units, the prepack would be fulfilled since the remaining unfulfilled prepack quantity is less than 41% (20% and 40%, respectively). </p></li><li><p>For 2 units of demand, the 60% is greater than the 41% threshold so the prepack will not be fulfilled.</p></li></ul></body>
