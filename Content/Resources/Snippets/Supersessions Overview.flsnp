        <p>Supersessions are used to create accurate demand forecasts for items with little or no history. Supersessions are paramount when launching a new product and there is a need to plan the right quantity of that product in stores or warehouses. 
		</p>
        <p>The new product is linked to a similar existing product or products creating demand forecasts for the new item based on the  sales history of the existing item. Also, supersessions can be used to set up replacement strategies that replenish the existing item's stock with the new item. </p>
