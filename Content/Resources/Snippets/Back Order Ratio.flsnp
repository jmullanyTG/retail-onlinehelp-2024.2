        <p>The back order ratio, also known as the back order rate, represents the anticipated portion of lost sales that is likely to lead to a future purchase. This metric quantifies the percentage of forecasted inventory that should be ordered to address returning customer demand. Essentially, it outlines the expected percentage of customer back orders for future fulfillment, distinguishing them from lost sales.</p>
