        <h1>Lookup columns</h1>
        <p>The lookup columns can be configured to increase the usability of the data grid widget by referencing lookup data and presenting it to the user in a more familiar or more user-friendly format. The lookup column must be accompanied by a method (stored procedure) which will return the lookup data. </p>
        <p class="Example">If the returned data is the product status ID (which is an INT 1-10) and the user wants to change it, the lookup column runs a separate query to the database to give the associate friendly name text values for the 1-10 IDs based on a SELECT from a different table).</p>
