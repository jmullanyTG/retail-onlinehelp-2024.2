        <h1>Using machine learning to improve forecasting</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Gradient Boosting</span> Forecasting Method is based on machine learning. The machine learning algorithm uses Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to analyze all relevant historical data (known as features) relating to demand patterns (e.g. seasonality, brands), business decisions (e.g. Promotions, changes in display and space), and external factors (e.g. holidays, footfall, weather). The historical data is then translated into an extremely accurate prediction or forecast.</p>
        <p>One major feature of Gradient Boosting is that it outperforms the statistical systems on sparse data. For example, items with low sales are associated with other, similar items with low sales, and historic examples of items with low sales. Subtle or obscured connections between features can be uncovered leading to more accurate forecasts and improved sales. Additionally, machine learning requires fewer resources while leveraging all data for each series, is easy to scale, and can result in significantly improved forecasting at aggregate levels.</p>
        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough's implementation of Gradient Boosting is designed for Cloud deployments only. With this Cloud implementation, there is the ability to horizontally scale to shorten calculation times.</p>
        <p>The Forecast Method <span class="Emphasis">Gradient Boosting</span> displays only for Cloud deployments and is  for Inventory Forecast only since it is at an item site level.</p>

        <h3>High level process flow</h3>
        <p>The Trainer API generates fit models. The Inference API uses the fit models generated by the Trainer API to make a forecast. 

			When users run an inventory forecast, the Forecast API gets the inference predictions and tournaments them against other statistical forecast methods to determine the best fit. The output forecast method is called <span class="Emphasis">Gradient Boosting</span> in the Forecast viewer. 

		</p>
        <h3>Analysis Installer</h3>
        <p>Gradient Boosting requires the <span class="Emphasis">Analysis</span> Installer. This installer is required to install the Analysis API and is required to be run on its own compute node. These compute nodes can be configured remotely using dialog windows in which users configure the audience, instance name, and the base application server address. This removes the need to follow a manual configuration process for each compute node reducing the chances of errors.</p>
        <h3>Job Manager tasks</h3>
        <p>Two Job Manager tasks need to be configured to run the machine learning.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The Training and Inferencing Job Tasks clear previous run data to prevent stale data runs.</p>

        <h3>Analyzing MFP&#160;plan level data</h3>
        <p>The following job manager tasks need to be configured to allow TG JE's implementation of Gradient Boosting to analyze MFP plan level data (plans and channels):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>(DF) (Monthly) Gradient Boosting MFP Run Train process</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>(DF) (Weekly) Gradient Boosting MFP Run Inference process</p>
            </li>
