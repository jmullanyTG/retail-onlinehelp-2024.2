        <h1>Forecast method and method fit</h1>
        <p>The forecast method name displayed represents the tournament winner and its respective method fit (based on the error method used). For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="MAPE and ATE error metric overview.htm">Error method overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Use the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Method</span> dropdown list to view the results of the forecast tournament for that particular item. The results are ordered by their respective method fit scores.  Any method with a result of 0.00% is considered to have been disqualified from the tournament and the reason for its disqualification is listed in the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Message</span> field. </p>
        <p>Forecast parameters display similar information to the details tab, but gives an opportunity to compare the different methods at a glance.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Method Fit</span> is a percentage value indicating how well a forecast method matches sales history. As part of the forecast tournament process, a method fit array is generated starting with the first sales history value and progressively determining what the forecast would have been with the selected method.</p>
