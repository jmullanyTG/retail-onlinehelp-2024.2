        <h1>Inventory level phase-in and phase-out</h1>
        <p> Phase-in and phase-out dates for products or sets of products are set in Inventory Manager. These dates operate differently from the application of a redundant/discontinued order policy in that they null out the effective forecast values outside the bounds of the phase period. </p>
        <p>Manipulate the order policy to affect ordering behavior.</p>
