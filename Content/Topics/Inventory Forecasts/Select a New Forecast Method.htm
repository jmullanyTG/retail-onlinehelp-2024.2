        <h1>Selecting a different forecast method </h1>
        <p>If the forecast method used for a given forecast has a low method fit or just does not make sense (for example, the item is not seasonal but a seasonal method was used), choose a different method to be used for the forecast. </p>
        <h2>To select a different forecast method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Forecasts screen, click <span class="Emphasis">Lock</span> on the toolbar.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Task</span> dialog box, select only the methods to be considered when forecasting demand for the item.</p>
                <p>For example, do not select their checkboxes if seasonal forecast methods shouldn't be used.</p>

        </ol>
        <h2>Validity of selections</h2>
        <p>The selections made in the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Task</span> dialog box remain valid until new selections are made or the date defined in the <span class="Emphasis">Lock Expiration</span> field is reached.</p>
        <h2>Unlocking selections</h2>
        <p> Click <span class="Emphasis">Unlock</span> on the toolbar to re-open the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Task</span> dialog to select different methods after a forecast has been locked.</p>
