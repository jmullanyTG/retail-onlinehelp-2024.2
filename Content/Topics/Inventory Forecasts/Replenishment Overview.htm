        <h1>Replenishment process</h1>
        <p>Replenishment is the process of ordering stock over time to meet anticipated demand. The replenishment process is driven automatically according to the following inputs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>forecasted daily demand for each item at each location.</li>
            <li>projected daily stock on hand at store locations and distribution centers.</li>
            <li>replenishment related ordering parameters defined for items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used to automatically create the best possible replenishment strategy for the organization optimizing the orders available in the Order Manager. These orders ensure that stock arrives at distribution centers and individual store locations just in time to meet anticipated demand, with the minimum required overhead.</p>
        <p>The replenishment process is as follows:</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this process, the statistical forecasts predict the unconstrained daily demand for each item at each location. Before orders can be placed, however, the ordering rules set up for each item must be considered. Factors such as minimum and maximum order quantities, lead times, supply chains, etc. all influence how orders are optimized.</p>
        <p>After an optimal replenishment plan is created for items based on the demand forecast and replenishment parameters, the orders are created in the Order Manager.</p>
        <p>Although the replenishment process is automated and happens largely behind-the-scenes, the ongoing replenishment status for items can be monitored through the Inventory Manager.</p>
