        <h1>Cluster Sets view </h1>
        <p> The <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view contains all the essential metrics for building sales plans and the functionality to make Cluster Set or Cluster level changes to the single placeholder or collection selected in the main planning view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Set View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view is displayed or hidden in Placeholder view using the <span class="Emphasis">View Selection</span> dropdown menu.</p>
        <h2>Creating preferred layouts within the Cluster Sets view</h2>
        <p>Clicking on the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> button displays a screen similar to the standard <span class="Emphasis">Fields Customization</span> screen. The only difference is that the filter, row, and column sections are absent. This is because only the data items can be amended.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Sets Fields Customization.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Users can move fields between the <span class="Emphasis">Data Area</span> and <span class="Emphasis">None Area</span> to show or hide fields. Both sections are multi-select enabled to allow for bulk editing. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Sets Layouts.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>When a desired layout has been achieved, users can right-click in the Cluster Sets grid and select <span class="Emphasis">Save Layout</span>. The original or another layout can be selected using the appropriate right-click menu option.</p>
        <h2>Sub clustering by attribute for placeholders and collections</h2>
        <p>Sub clustering by attribute allows for clusters to be created which support clustering by grade and sub clustering by climate. For example, swimwear might have an earlier phase-in date for Warm stores than for Cold stores. To avoid having to update the phase-in date for A-Warm, B-Warm, C-Warm, etc. one at a time the <span class="Emphasis">Sub Cluster</span> field can be used at an aggregated level (for example, update the phase-in date for all Warm stores at once). </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Sub Cluster</span> field is best placed in the <span class="Emphasis">Column Area</span> of the grid.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Sub Cluster Cold Warm.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The ability to bulk edit across sub clusters supports user stories such as defining phase dates by sub cluster attribute at an aggregate level, rather than for each cluster-sub cluster at a time. Values are apportioned and pushed down according to existing rules within the system. Editability is as per the existing rules.</p>
        <p>The value that displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Sub Cluster</span> field is the value selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Sub Clustering Attribute</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Cluster Set</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Update Cluster Set</span> screens within the Site Clustering module. This field displays <span class="Emphasis">N/A</span> if the cluster does not have a sub-cluster.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information,<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly"> see <MadCap:xref href="../Cluster Site Manager/Configuring sub-clusters.htm">Configuring sub-clusters.</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly"> refer to the Site Clustering User Guide.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view responds to the selection of multiple placeholders or placeholder collections in the main planning view. To facilitate this functionality, three fields can be used to identify the placeholders selected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Placeholder ID</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">PH Code</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">PH Desc</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">In the <span class="Emphasis">Collection</span> view these fields are the corresponding Placeholder Collection identifiers.</p>
        <p>These fields are best used in the <span class="Emphasis">Row Area</span> and are most useful when showing multiple placeholders at once. For example, users can view values at a more aggregated level across multiple placeholders / clusters.</p>
        <h2>Visibility to actual ROS and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales</h2>
        <p>The ROS&#160;metric reflects a combination of actual and planned sales in a single ROS&#160;metric. The following metrics split actual and planned sales out. This provides better visibility to the actual ROS for  active sites and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reg Ftr Site Count, Reg Ftr ROS ($), Reg Ftr ROS (U), Reg Ftr Site ($), Reg Ftr Site (U), Reg Ftr AUR ($), Act ROS ($), Act ROS (U)</li>
            <li>SPV ROS ($), SPV ROS (U), SPV Sales ($), SPV Sales (U)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Changes that cause Total Sales Units to change cascade down to the Regular Future figures as well.</p>
