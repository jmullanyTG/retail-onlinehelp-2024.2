        <h1>Promotions planning</h1>
        <p>Promotions planning is provided as supplemental functionality to the main and supporting views in Assortment Planning. This functionality can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> estimate promotional effects on sales plans so ensuring sufficient stock to support those sales. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>plan differences in promotional effects and time frames all the way down to the placeholder/cluster level and easily create product and site level exclusions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>plan multiple overlapping promotions with various interaction behaviors and best-deal logic built in for advanced planning flexibility.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
