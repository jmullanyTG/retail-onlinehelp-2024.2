        <h1>Promotion concepts</h1>
        <h2>Promotions and promotion applications</h2>
        <p>Defined Promotions can be thought of as templates that can be used many times. They don’t have ties to specific products or areas of the site hierarchy. At their core, they are a promotional index and an AUR effect that can be applied to different areas of a business, rather than having to create a separate promotion every time users want to take 30% off a different group of products. </p>
        <p>Promotion Applications are the actual product, site level, and time specific incarnation of Defined Promotions. As such, a single Defined Promotion can have infinite Promotion Applications.</p>
        <h2>Promotions and AUR</h2>
        <p>AUR is a function of blended ticket price (<span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span>) and any promotions in effect. This is because assortment plans are done at the placeholder/collection level as opposed to the aggregate level used in merchandise financial plans. Because promotion participation can be managed at a site level, the system calculates a blended AUR based on each site’s percent contribution to the cluster it is assigned to for a given period.</p>
        <h2>Overlapping promotions</h2>
        <p>It is possible to have multiple promotions with different AUR effects and Promotional Indices active for the same products and clusters at the same time. How these promotions interact with each other is defined by their Stacking Behaviors. </p>
        <p>There is the option of choosing whether promotions active during the same period will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> combine to produce greater promotional effects</li>
            <li> be used instead of other promotions present based on best-deal logic, or </li>
            <li>supersede other active promotions altogether.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Defined Promotions Section.htm">Defined Promotions Section</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <h2>Promotional indices</h2>
        <p>In very basic scenarios, the Final Index specified for a promotion is what appears for the relevant periods in the Promotion Index field of Sales Plan view for a given placeholder/cluster. Users should be aware that the actual Promotion Index shown may differ from this due to site level exclusions and Stacking Behaviors, when multiple promotions are present.</p>
        <h2>Supplemental information on promotion applications</h2>
        <p>There is a supplemental Microsoft Excel model on the calculation of AUR, VAT, and Promotional Indices available to ToolsGroup JustEnough consultants, which details the specific calculations used when promotions are applied.</p>
