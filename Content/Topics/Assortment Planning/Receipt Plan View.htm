        <h1>Receipt Plan view</h1>
        <p>The ideal receipt strategy for items to be purchased can be identified using the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. Functionality includes the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>set constraints, such as minimum Periods of Supply</li>
            <li>
                <p> define the periods in which receipts are allowed to arrive and how many receipts are needed</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">This can be overridden in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Periods</span> view. The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Periods</span> view provides an aggregate level view for specifying if particular periods are or are not flow dates for all items in a particular level of the product hierarchy. See <MadCap:xref href="Managing Plans and Set Defaults.htm#Receipt">Receipt Periods</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>send commitment orders to  Order Manager for final processing, review, approval, and submission to external systems.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>System policies</h2>
        <p>A number of system policies affect the output of the Receipt Planning Engine. These system policies are managed in <span class="Emphasis">Maintenance &gt; Policies</span>. However, this should not be done without the assistance of a technical consultant. Possible exceptions are:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Assortment Engine DC-to-Cluster Lead Time</span>: This setting determines the Default Lead Time Days from the DC to the Cluster that will be used to calculate Next Order Date information.  This will be rounded to the nearest period.</p>
        <p>When the engine is calculating receipts, this setting essentially determines the range of periods it must consider to meet the defined constraints for a given period. See examples for Periods of Supply and Min Stk to Sales below for details.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Assortment Engine Supplier-to-DC Lead Time</span>: Sets the Default Lead Time Days from the Supplier to the DC that is used to determine eligible receipt dates.  This will be rounded to the nearest period.
Default value is 7.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Allow Receipts After Markdown</span>: When set to <span class="Emphasis">False</span> (default), the Receipt Plan only considers the regular portion of the Sales plan and ignores the markdown phase of the plan. Set the system policy to <span class="Emphasis">True</span> if additional stock should be ordered beyond the planned markdown date.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If system policy<span class="Emphasis"> Editibility of Receipt AUC</span> is set to 2 (AUC is only managed through imports), then AUC is read-only for Placeholders with a status of Assigned, Committed, Replen, and Allocate. For placeholders with a status of Open and Created, AUC&#160;is editable. </p>
        <h2>Restricting roles from changing plans in the Receipt Plan view</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Read Write Access To Sales Plans Overrides.flsnp" />
        <h2>Fractional values in quantity fields, recalculation, and rounding</h2>
        <p>If a fractional value is entered in a quantity field (in any way), the recalculation step does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>values below 1 and above 0 round to 1, otherwise standard rounding rules apply.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">In the UI, values appear to round to 0 but after the calculation (when the SQL Server pivot recalculates) such values round up to 1.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>for values entered at an aggregated level, a rounded split ensures that all values are whole numbers and that the total is split (for example, a value of 41 entered at the top level splits to 11 - 10 - 10 - 10).</p>

        <h2>Modifying receipt planning constraints for multiple Placeholders </h2>
        <p>Multiple Placeholders can be selected in the main planning view and their receipt planning constraints modified in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. However, if multiple Placeholders are selected, then the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan</span> section in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view is greyed out. </p>
        <p>After editing the constraints for multiple Placeholders, create Commitments by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Create Commitments</span>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#CreatingCommitments">Creating commitments</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p> To restore default constraints, select the individual Placeholders one at a time in the main planning view.</p>

        <h2>Recalculating receipts for multiple Placeholders with a Receipt Status of Dirty</h2>
        <p>To recalculate multiple Placeholders with a <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Status</span> of <span class="Emphasis">Dirty</span>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the main planning view, select multiple Placeholders with a <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Status</span> of <span class="Emphasis">Dirty</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Receipt Plan view, click <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span>.</p>
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Status</span> for the selected Placeholders updates to <span class="Emphasis">Clean</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Recalculating Receipt plans without Dirty status</h2>
        <p>
Users can click the <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> button when selected on a single placeholder and rerun the receipt engine, even if the status is not <span class="Emphasis">Dirty</span>.</p>
        <h3>Editable metrics</h3>
        <p>Denoted by light blue row coloration, these are the only metrics that are editable in Receipt Plan view. All other metrics are calculations or reads from other sources. </p>
        <p>Changing Minimum Presentation in this view updates Min Pres in the Main Planning and Cluster Set views, and in Sales Plan View.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Changing Receipt Units in this view does not update metrics in the Main Planning or Cluster Set views. This is by design. Receipts are suggested in Assortment Planning via a complex algorithm considering sales and all user-specified constraints. As sales are considered in the output already, to update <span class="Emphasis">Ttl Buy U</span> would cause the sales plan to change. This might potentially invalidate the results of the receipt calculation. However, it updates Receipt Units in Sales Plan view, as will changing Receipt AUC.</p>
        <h3>Calculations</h3>
        <p>Receipt plans are calculated via the Receipt Planning Engine, which uses a complex algorithm to determine the optimal receipt flow based on sales and minimum presentation by period and user-defined constraints. As a result, system receipt recommendations require a user action to recalculate rather than recalculating dynamically as changes are made in the user interface. </p>
        <p>Recalculation can be done either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> for the selected placeholder or collection only by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> in this view, or </li>
            <li>for all placeholders/collections that require recalculation by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate</span> in the main planning view header area.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Receipt Planning Engine outputs</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">System Receipt Units</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Ideal EOP Units</span> metrics are outputs of the Receipt Planning Engine, which must be re-run when any of the inputs it considered change. These fields are conditionally formatted any time a change is made that could invalidate the results of the last engine run. Changes to sales, min pres, shrink, inventory adjustments, or receipt constraints all fall into this category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan Engine Output Formatting.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Plan Horizon versus Receipt Planning Engine Horizon</h3>
        <p>If the Plan Horizon, set at the time of plan creation, extends beyond the receipt planning engine horizon for a given item, data that extends past the receipt engine horizon appears in blue italics with zero values. See example in <span class="Emphasis">Plan Horizon vs. Replen Forecast Horizon</span> below.</p>
        <h3>Understanding receipt engine recommendations</h3>
        <p>The following metrics surface diagnostic information in the Receipt Plan view to better explain why the receipt engine recommended the quantities it did.</p>

        </table>
        <h3>Placeholders and collections in Replen status</h3>
        <p>When a placeholder or collection is in <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> status, all relevant data is pulled to form its sales plan from the <span class="Emphasis">Forecasts</span> module. Users should be aware of the following differences in this view when dealing with Replen items:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Read Only</span>: All normally editable metrics in Receipt Plan view become read-only being populated directly from aggregated replenishment forecast data.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Receipt Constraints</span>: All receipt related constraints are managed within the <span class="Emphasis">Forecasts</span> module. Thus, receipt constraints in Assortment Planning for placeholders and collections with a status of <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> are cleared. With a change of status to something other than <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span>, the default constraints assigned to any corresponding product level is reinstated.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Receipt Periods</span>: For placeholders and collections with a status of <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span>, the necessary orders to support forecasted sales are generated from the <span class="Emphasis">Forecasts</span> module and sent to Order Manager for processing. Users do not need to set receipt periods in this view the way they do for non-Replen items. Receipt Periods are set automatically based on when the generated orders are scheduled to arrive.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Plan Horizon vs. Replen Forecast Horizon</span>: If the Plan Horizon, set at the time of plan creation, extends beyond the replenishment forecast horizon for a given item, the system conditionally formats the periods that go beyond the replenishment forecast as shown below to draw the user’s attention to this. These periods also display zeros for the metrics being read from replenishment data, as no forecast exists:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan Horizon Blue Formatting.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Working with receipt plans</h2>
        <h3>Recalculating receipts</h3>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> button re-runs the Receipt Planning Engine for the selected placeholder or collection and populates the <span class="Emphasis">System Receipt Units</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Ideal EOP Units</span> fields with the results. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information regarding receipt plan default constraints, see <MadCap:xref href="Managing Plans and Set Defaults.htm#Defaults">Defaults </MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p> Receipt recalculations require complex calculations and are sent to the Workload Queue module for scheduling and processing. Though receipts are recalculated immediately, they can be deferred for later calculation based on the number of placeholders requiring recalculation and other jobs currently in the queue. Placeholders awaiting recalculation are locked and conditionally formatted to indicate this.</p>
        <p>Receipts for placeholders/collections in Replen status are calculated in the Forecasts module and read in, thus they will never appear “Dirty” and will not be recalculated when this button is clicked. Instead, the following displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholder Managed by Replenishment.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>All changes to plans, including changes made to constraints in the Receipt Plan supporting view, must be saved prior to recalculating receipts or they will not be taken into account by the Receipt Engine.</p>
        <h3><a name="CreatingCommitments"></a>Creating commitments</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Create Commitments</span> button sends receipt plan details for all defined Receipt Periods in the current view provided:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> The <span class="Emphasis">Commit</span> checkbox for the period is checked, and </li>
            <li>There is a positive Receipt Units quantity in the period.
				<p>Since orders for placeholders and collections in <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> status are generated in the <span class="Emphasis">Forecasts</span> module, it is not necessary to create commitment orders for them in Assortment Planning, thus no commitment orders are generated for such items when this button is clicked. Instead, the following message displays:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholder Managed by Replenishment.png" class="LargeImages" /></p><p>If no receipt plans are found that meet the above criteria, the following message displays:</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/No Records To Process For Commitments Warning.png" class="LargeImages" /></p></li>

        <h3>Restoring default constraints</h3>
        <p>Default constraints for both placeholders and placeholder clusters can be restored by selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Restore Default Constraints</span> button. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">As part of restoring the default constraints involves resetting the receipt periods for the placeholder/collection, receipts are automatically recalculated as part of this process.

        <h3><a name="Metrics"></a>Metrics that account for stock in transit </h3>
        <p>In Assortment Planning,  Total Order metrics are inclusive of supplier orders and internal stock movements (also known as Inter-Branch Transfers or IBT). The <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan</span> grid has metrics that differentiate between inbound supplier orders and IBT orders providing visibility to these components. </p>
        <p>Additionally, On Order metrics provide visibility to supplier orders that have been sent to the supplier (<span class="Emphasis">Committed</span>), received back from the supplier as confirmed (<span class="Emphasis">Confirmed</span>), or if there's an unknown status (<span class="Emphasis">Unknown</span>).</p>
        <p class="p">The <span class="Emphasis">Past Due</span> metrics provide visibility to orders that were expected to be receipted in the recent past. Past Due is broken out to provide visibility to all orders that are past due as well as current. These metrics provide visibility to where stock is, whether it's late or on time, whether it's moving inside the channel, etc.</p>
        <p>These metrics are available in some or all of the following: <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view, <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view, <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Rollup</span> view, and the <span class="Emphasis">Reconciliation Report</span>.</p>
        <h3>Inter-Branch Transfer (IBT) metrics</h3>
        <p>Separate Cost fields exist for each of the different On Order Unit metrics in <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. For example, <span class="Emphasis">Committed On Order Units</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Committed On Order Cost</span>. </p>

        <p><span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to Cluster</span> is stock in transit to stores within a cluster specifically whereas <span class="Emphasis">Total Stock In Transit</span> is stock in transit to any locale in the network, store or DC). Metric  

<span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to DCs Split</span> is the difference between the two.</p>
        <h4>Committed On Order Units</h4>
        <p>Units for which commitment orders have been created but which do not have corresponding confirmed purchase orders. Auto-populated when commitments are created for periods having Receipt Units. This fields reads from commitment orders for the corresponding variant/cluster/period in Order Manager. Receipt units for a given period are transitioned out of Receipt Units to Committed Units when commitments are created for that period.</p>
        <p class="Important">Commitment Units can be automatically decremented based on the presence of confirmed On Order Units but only if the <span class="Emphasis">Import Config</span> setting <span class="Emphasis">Order Units</span> for planned periods  is set to Variant Orders and ToolsGroup JustEnough has integrated with an ERP/POM system capable of returning order data with the UUIDs ToolsGroup JustEnough generates for each order sent. If this is not the case, a custom procedure is needed to appropriately decrement Commitment Units and avoid duplication of units with On Order (Unknown) Units (where purchase order units the system is unable to tie to specific commitment orders populate).</p>
        <h4>Confirmed On Order Units</h4>

                <p>A health check shows if the stock on hand plan goes negative at some point in the future of the plan. This check is only validated against the override <span class="Emphasis">EOP Units</span> value (i.e. incorporating user overrides of sales and receipts), and it only looks for negative values during the regular period of the item. Therefore, it is not a concern for an item to have negative SOH during the markdown portion of the lifecycle. The following is an example of the health error details:</p>

                <p>Calculation: System Receipt Units – Committed Units – On Order Units – On Order (Unknown) Units</p>
                <p>Once a commitment order has been created, the quantity that was in this field moves into the Committed Units field indicating that an order has been generated for the planned quantity. As the order moves through the commitment process, the units will transition or On Order Units (or On Order (Unknown) Units) and then ultimately show again as receipt units when the period in question actualizes, provided the units were actually received in that period. This ensures that units for the same order are not double-counted as they move through the process.</p>
                <p>Once the above transition occurs, it is still possible to add more Receipt Units to this field and place subsequent commitment orders for them as needed. The additional quantity can be entered and <span class="Emphasis">Create Commitments</span> clicked. This can happen automatically as the sales plan changes as a result of receipt plan recalculations.  Each individual order contributes to the totals shown and is tracked and transitioned through the applicable fields individually.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Entering Receipt Units at the Grand Total level in this view is a quick way to balance a receipt plan to the Ttl Buy U in the Main Planning and/or Cluster Set views if desired. Aggregate the pivot grid to the desired level by removing fields as needed (i.e. Cluster Set, Cluster, Style, etc.) and enter the Ttl Buy U value in the Grand Total column at the far right. The structure of the receipt plan, including flow dates and % to total of receipt units by period, is respected while the system balances the period level entries to match the new Grand Total.</p>
