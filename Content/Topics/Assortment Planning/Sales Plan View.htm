        <h1>Sales Plan view </h1>
        <p>Period level edits to sales plans of selected placeholders or collections can be made using the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view. Edits can be either in total or by average store and compared to the high level plan created in the main planning view of the Placeholder or Collection views. Inventory can be tracked and shrink and adjustments planned for more detailed control both pre and in-season.</p>

        <h2>Matching Sales Plans with Life Cycle and Seasonality Curves</h2>
        <p>Where the periods between a Sales Plan and a Life Cycle or Seasonality Curve do not exactly match, configure the system to either match up the periods of the Sales Plan with the periods of the Life Cycle or Seasonality Curve or stretch or shrink the curve to match the size of the sales plan. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Which behavior is used is determined by system policies <span class="Emphasis">Algorithm To Match Seasonality Curve to Sales Plan</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Algorithm To Match Lifecycle Curve to Sales Plan</span>. For more information, on setting these system policies, see <MadCap:xref href="Assortment Planning related System Policies.htm">Assortment planning related system policies</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Viewing actualized internal stock movement metrics</h2>
        <p>Four metrics provide further visibility to internal stock movements (also known as Inter-Branch Transfers or IBT) between locations for historical periods. These metrics are only populated for actualized periods with future periods always being zero or null.</p>
        <p>These metrics are included in the calculation to provide the current period’s BOP value with all stock being considered regardless of where it is.</p>
        <p>The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Units In Transit Cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Units In Transit DC&#160;Split</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Cost In Transit Cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Cost In Transit DC Split</p>

            <li><span class="Emphasis">Comparison metrics</span>: Denoted by purple row coloration and <span class="Emphasis">(Comparison)</span> appended to the end of the metric. For example, Sales (Comparison). These metrics are direct data reads from the selected Comparison Snapshot and default to zero if no snapshot is selected or no data is present in the snapshot.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Editable metrics</span>: Denoted by light blue row coloration. These are the only metrics that are editable by the user in <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view. All others are calculations or reads from other sources:
							<ul><li>* System, ex VAT, and Comparison metrics are never editable in Sales Plan view</li><p class="BasicNote">With the exception of <span class="Emphasis">Selling Period</span>, edits made in <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view DO NOT change the plan values in the main planning view and Cluster Sets view. This is by design to allow for comparison of original plans with period level changes. However, the Sales Plan view <span class="Emphasis">Sls $</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Sls U</span> metrics can be brought into the main planning view to view these edits at the placeholder or collection or cluster set/cluster level.</p></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Ex VAT metrics</span>: Denoted by <span class="Emphasis">ex VAT</span> appended to the end of the metric name (for example, <span class="Emphasis">System Sales ex VAT</span>). Where VAT (value added tax) is in play, <span class="Emphasis">ex VAT</span> metrics provide accurate profit calculations (margin) after taxes have been removed.</p>
                <p>Where VAT is not in play, no customization of calculations is necessary. Navigate to <span class="Emphasis">System Utilities &gt; Views &gt; Maintenance &gt; Planning VAT Rate</span> and set the VAT rates for all levels of the product hierarchy assigned to the assortment plan to 0. This sets the <span class="Emphasis">ex VAT</span> metrics equal to the non ex VAT metrics.</p>

These periods also display zeros for the metrics being read from replenishment data, as no forecast exists:

            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Replen Placeholders/Collections</span>: When a placeholder/collection is of status <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span>, all relevant data is pulled in from the Forecasts module to form its sales plan.</p>
                <p>Users should be aware of the following differences in this view when dealing with Replen items:
			
				<span class="Emphasis">Read Only</span>: all normally editable metrics in Sales Plan view become read only, being populated directly from aggregated replenishment forecast data, with the exception of all Shrink and Inventory Adjustments related metrics, which remain editable and can still be planned normally.
					</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Retrend metrics</span>: The fields for Retrend metrics populate only after a user selects the <span class="Emphasis">Retrend</span> option in the <span class="Emphasis">Process Queue</span> section of the main planning view toolbar.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Supersession metrics</span>: The mapped metrics are: Stock On Hand (EOP -&gt; BOP) and Actualized Sales Units. Actualized metrics display in the Sales Plan View. EOP&#160;values populate new item BOP&#160;values. Additionally,<ul><li><p>Supersession date ranges are respected, even if they coincide oddly with phase dates. Specifically, supersession dates are used to narrow phase dates, but if no dates are set on the supersession, then phase dates are used.</p></li><li><p>If supersessions are set up for only some of the Inventories that make up a variant, then planned values are split using size curve and historical site contribution data.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">System</span>: Denoted by the word <span class="Emphasis">System</span> at the beginning (for example: System Sales) and green row coloration. System metrics are those based on the values shown in the main planning and <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> views.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User</span>: User metrics default to the system metrics of like name, but these are based on edits made in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view to the editable metrics. Thus, the user plan can diverge from the system plan in <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>LY metrics</h2>
        <p>LY metrics are only visible in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. LY metrics are not visible in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view.</p>
        <h2>Ship from Store (SFS) metric notes</h2>
        <p>Although Ship from Store values (Retail, Cost, Units) are reductions or negatives to e-commerce stock, it's more intuitive to plan SFS as a positive percentage. This is then used as a stock reduction through subtraction, rather than requiring a negative SFS percentage value.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">There are no Product Hierarchy Defaults for the Ship from Store (SFS) metrics. Therefore, there will be no default SFS percent value which can be assigned to a higher product level. The SFS percent is managed at the Item level.</p>
        <p>The metrics for Total Sales are not changed by the Ship from Store metrics as they display the Total Sales originating from that cluster set/cluster, regardless of fulfillment location. For example, e-commerce Total Sales will include all sales originating from e-commerce, including those fulfilled from stores. Retail Total Sales will consist of sales originating from Retail, NOT including SFS sales.</p>
        <p>Also, ROS metrics are not changed. The ROS for the channel represents the ROS for Sales originating from that cluster set/cluster, regardless of fulfillment location.</p>
        <h2>Selling Period checkbox</h2>
        <p>Users can select the <span class="Emphasis">Selling Period</span> checkbox to specify periods where sales are not planned for a selected placeholder or collection but is still in phase. If unchecked, then zeros out System Sales, System Sales Units, Sales, and Sales Units for the period. Thus, metrics in the main planning view and Cluster Set view are updated by this change. Users cannot enter sales for unchecked periods. When unchecked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>inventory (BOP, EOP) still calculates normally for the period</li>
            <li>receipts can still be realized for the period</li>
            <li>all Inventory Adjustments metrics (see below) can still be planned normally</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Common uses for this feature might be items that repeat seasonally, such as holiday themed goods, where inventory is retained between selling periods.</p>
        <h2>Wholesale related metrics</h2>
        <p>The following wholesale related metrics are available in the main planning view and the Cluster Sets, Sales Plan, Receipt Plan, and Top Down Core Plan views:</p>
