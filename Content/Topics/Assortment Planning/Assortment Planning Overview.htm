        <h1>Assortment Planning Overview</h1>
        <p>The Assortment Planning (AP) module provides the functionality to leverage scenario modeling capabilities through the Target Creation process to quickly lay a sound foundation for assortments or forge an assortment from the ground up using manual placeholder creation. Once a plan framework is created, fine tune at multiple levels, and apply supplemental analyses from integrated supporting modules to craft an ideal buy strategy.</p>
        <p>There is the ability to reconcile against financial targets and other goals through a variety of reporting tools, manage order commitments through integration with Order Manager and external systems, track plan accuracy, and make adjustments in-season.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The parameters selected during plan creation are the cornerstones of success in the assortment planning process. Business process discussions should be had prior to plan creation to understand the existing infrastructure into which plans will be integrated. If Merchandise Financial Planning or Allocations systems or processes are in place, assortment plans should be structured to facilitate the movement of data between them. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How is the business structured in terms of product? How many major categories are there and what subdivisions exist in each? What level of detail is needed in the product hierarchy?</li>
            <li>How is the business structured in terms of selling channels? Is there a need to segment by full and off-priced business, by country, by geography, some combination of all? Are there other factors related to site attributes (capacity, climate, demographic, etc.) that are used to group sites together?</li>
            <li>What is the structure of the financial reporting periods and what calendar is used to track them?</li>
            <li>What will be the primary planning currency for financial targets and comparisons? What about the additional taxes and costs of doing business internationally?</li>
            <li>What are the primary metrics and attributes against which the business will be measured?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Points to consider</h2>
        <p>It is vital that sufficient time is given to discuss the points presented above and to the pre-requisite steps outlined thereafter. Additionally, by taking the time to consider and set plan defaults that are appropriate to the business, workflows can be streamlined saving a great deal of time when planning.</p>
        <p>Consider the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span>: one of the strengths of AP is the ability to define business segments that are not directly tied to the product hierarchy. Spending time to strategize among the team and define what attributes are meaningful and then structuring the plan accordingly is a great way to uncover and address areas of opportunity with plans.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span>: cluster sets are the cornerstone of Assortment Planning. Carefully consider the areas of the business that different assortments are to be planned  for and/or those that will be managed by different individuals and create cluster sets accordingly.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Price Translations</span>: for companies doing business internationally, there are additional costs associated that can decrease a profit margin such as import and export fees, tariffs, higher real estate prices, etc. Price translations are a way of creating premium pricing by product hierarchy level, price range, and locale to help recoup those extra costs, if this is part of the corporate pricing strategy.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Plan Defaults</span>: Assortment Planning offers a wide array of defaults covering everything from cluster sets, seasonality, and size curves, to constraints such as periods of supply and pack tolerance percentages that are utilized as part of receipt planning and prepack optimization calculations. These can always be overridden later if needed, but taking the time to set defaults to cover the majority of cases can save  a great deal of time later.</li>
        </ul>
