                        <p>Care must be taken to use filters judiciously while comparing to MFP to get an apples-to-apples comparison. </p><p>
For example, if a hierarchy in MFP is configured as Company &gt; Dept &gt; Cat, and a filter is selected that contains the hierarchy selection of Company &gt; Mens &gt; Shirts, then placeholders for Mens Shirts and the MFP plan data for Mens Shirts are returned and are comparable. 

</p><p>However, if a filter is selected that is configured as Color = Blue, and there are blue items in Mens Shirts, Mens Pants, Womens Shirts, and Womens Pants, then the AP lines show totals for all blue items across those categories, but MFP data is unable to constrain on only blue items, so MFP data shows total: Mens Shirts + Mens Pants + Womens Shirts + Womens Pants. </p><p>This must be kept in mind when choosing a filter for use when running the Reconciliation report against MFP.                    </p></td>
