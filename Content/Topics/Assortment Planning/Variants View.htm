        <h1>Variants view (only available in collection view)</h1>
        <p>In Collection view, the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> supporting view provides access to the individual placeholders that exist within each collection. <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> view automatically updates to show the placeholders within the selected collection.</p>

        <h2>Header area functionality</h2>
        <p>The header area functionality in <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> view is essentially the same as those in the main planning view. The exception is the ability to change the data filter parameters since the view is linked to the selected collection in the main planning view. </p>
        <h2>Planning area and metrics</h2>
        <p>The planning area in <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> view functions in the same way as the main planning view in Placeholder view including all metrics, the ability to add or remove columns via the column chooser in View Options, and the ability to save and restore layouts. </p>
        <h2>Style bank</h2>
        <p>Use the style bank to assign variants to placeholders in <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> view in the exact same manner as in Placeholder view of the main planning view. </p>
