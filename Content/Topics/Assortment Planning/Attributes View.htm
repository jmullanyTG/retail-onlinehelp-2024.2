        <h1>Attributes view</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view is used to view and manage product attributes for placeholders and collections.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information on <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Families</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Values</span>, and how their eligibility is set for items within the product hierarchy, see <MadCap:xref href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Management Overview.htm">Attribute Management and Assignment Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Attributes View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view is displayed or hidden in Placeholder view using the <span class="Emphasis">View Selection</span> dropdown menu.</p>
        <h2>Viewing Attribute values that are longer than 256 characters</h2>
        <p>NVARCHAR(MAX) is a non-editable Attribute type enabling users to view attribute values longer than 256 characters. NVARCHAR(MAX) is only available in the Collection / Placeholder <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> supporting view.</p>
        <p> A related functionality allows the <span class="Emphasis">Notes</span> field in the main planning view to display greater than 256 characters.</p>
        <h2>Data population</h2>
        <p>The view populates with all attribute families that any of the selected placeholders or collections is eligible for. Attribute values available for selection include all values that any of the selected items is eligible for. Attribute family and value eligibility can be set via <span class="Emphasis">Maintenance &gt; Attribute Management</span>.</p>
        <h2>Applying changes across multiple items</h2>
        <p>Whether multiple lines are selected in the main planning view, changes are being applied in Collection view, or both the system automatically resolves any conflicts that exist between the applied values and the attribute value eligibility of the items the change is being applied to.</p>
        <p>Single-select attribute value changes are applied to all placeholders and collections that are eligible for them. Ineligible placeholders and collections remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>Multi-select attribute value changes are applied additively to placeholders and collections that are eligible for them. If only some of the applied values are eligible, then those are applied. Ineligible placeholders and collections remain unchanged.</p>
        <h2>
            <a name="Dual-dir">
            </a>Dual-directional attribute flow</h2>
        <p>Depending on where attributes are assigned – to placeholders in Assortment Planning or to variants in Variant Manager – attributes are transferred when a variant is assigned to a placeholder</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">System policy <span class="Emphasis">Multi Value Attribute Inheritance</span> governs the inheritance of multi-value attribute families when variants are assigned. When set to <span class="Emphasis">FALSE</span>, multi-value families are applied additively to existing values when variants are assigned.</p>
        <p class="Example">A placeholder has the multi-value family Embellishments and the values Flocked and Sequinned currently set. If a user assigns a variant with the Embellishments values Flocked and Embroidered to that placeholder, then the resulting values for the Embellishments family are: Flocked, Sequinned, and Embroidered.</p>
        <h2>Assigning a variant</h2>
        <p> Product attributes attached to a variant are transferred to the placeholder. Any attributes that are already assigned to the placeholder that don’t conflict with the variant attributes (i.e. single-select families that the variant already had assigned) remain on the placeholder and also are transferred to the variant.</p>
        <p>When set to <span class="Emphasis">TRUE</span>, multi value families overwrite the existing values when variants are assigned.</p>
        <p class="Example">Using the same case as the example above, the resulting values for Embellishments would be: Flocked and&#160;Embroidered only.</p>
        <h2>Attribute changes in Assortment Planning</h2>
        <p> System policy <span class="Emphasis">Update Variant Attributes In Assortment Planning</span> (Module: Assortment) governs whether changes are allowed to attribute families attached to variants. When set to <span class="Emphasis">FALSE</span>, all attribute families attached to the assigned variant appear grayed out and are locked for editing.</p>
        <p>Creating attribute families that only have the entity type Variant Placeholder assigned allows additional attribute families that cannot be attached to variants and will only be used inside of Assortment Planning for placeholders. </p>
        <p>When set to <span class="Emphasis">TRUE</span>, attribute families can be locked or unlocked individually within the Attribute Management solution. Families assigned to the variant entity type and having the AP Updates Variants setting checked are editable in Assortment Planning even when variants are assigned. Changes made to these families in Assortment Planning are transferred to the assigned variant for the product hierarchy assigned to the active assortment plan but are not transferred to other placeholders that variant is assigned to. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information on the <span class="Emphasis">AP Updates Variants</span> setting, see <MadCap:xref href="../Attribute Management/Creating and maintaining attribute families.htm">Creating and maintaining attribute families</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Attribute changes in Variant Manager</h2>
        <p> Changes made to variant attributes in <span class="Emphasis">Variant Manager</span> are transferred to all placeholders that variant is currently assigned to across all existing assortment plans that have the selected Variant Hierarchy assigned.</p>
