        <h1>Configuring a default personal workspace</h1>
        <p>Within Assortment Planning, users can create default personal workspaces that save time and improve productivity. The workspaces are configurations of visible views which enable particular tasks such as setting (and saving a workspace with) Placeholder, Style Bank, and Cluster Sets views docked and visible to support Cluster Assortment planning.  </p>

        </p>
        <p>Select the checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Default</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Workspaces</span> dialog to designate a particular workspace configuration as the default workspace. This default workspace displays  each time the application is loaded. Additionally, the default workspace can be edited and re-saved in future as needs change.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">As only private workspaces can be made default this functionality is specific to individual users only. A workspace cannot be a default if its <span class="Emphasis">Protection Type</span> is <span class="Emphasis">Public</span>.</p>
