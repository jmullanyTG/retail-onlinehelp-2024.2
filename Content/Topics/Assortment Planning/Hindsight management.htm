        <h2>Customizing the columns included in the Current and Historical views</h2>
        <p>Right-click in either grid header and select <span class="Emphasis">Column Chooser</span> to customize the columns that appear in the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> views.</p>
        <h2>Editing multiple rows simultaneously</h2>
        <p>To edit multiple rows simultaneously:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select multiple rows.</li>
            <li> Right-click in a field that is blue in color.</li>
            <li>Choose <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> from the context menu.</li>
            <li>Update the fields as required in the <span class="Emphasis">Multi Data Change Form</span>.</li>
            <li>Click Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Dragging and dropping</h2>
        <p>Regardless of the view configuration (with Current on the left and Historical on the right or vice versa) users can drag and drop items from both sections to the other to set <span class="Emphasis">Map From</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Map To</span> (see below for details on these fields).</p>
        <h2>Filtering results</h2>
        <p>To filter results, hover the mouse in the top right of each column header and click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Filter Results icon.png" class="IconInline" /> icon to display a filter dialog. </p>
        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Coll Code</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Coll Desc</span> column headers, click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Filter Results icon.png" class="IconInline" /> icon and select a value or type in the text field to filter the results returned.  <span class="Emphasis">%</span> is a wildcard to do “contains” type filtering instead.</p>
        <p>To create a new collection,  enter a description for the collection in the space provided and click <span class="Emphasis">New</span>.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Toolbar functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis"># Placeholders</span>, <span class="Emphasis"># Collections</span>: The number of new placeholder or collection lines to add when <span class="Emphasis">New</span> is clicked.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">New</span>: </p>
                <p>In <span class="Emphasis">Placeholder</span> view: Adds the number of new placeholder lines specified in <span class="Emphasis"># Placeholders</span> to the bottom of the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> grid. </p>
                <p>In <span class="Emphasis">Collection</span> view: Adds the number of new collections specified in <span class="Emphasis"># Collections</span> to the bottom of the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> grid. The number of placeholders to be added is specified in the <span class="Emphasis">PH Count</span> field.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Copy</span>: Lets users bulk select and copy placeholders or collections in the <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> grid. All details, attributes, and the new adjusted ROS, comparison stock and end date are copied. For collections, copies all existing placeholders from the original collection, but drops variant mapping, so the new collections consist of the same number of placeholders as LY.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Clear</span>: Removes mapped <span class="Emphasis">Like Styles</span> for selected placeholders or collections.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Delete</span>: Deletes selected new placeholders or collections. Existing placeholders are deleted in the main planning view.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Mirror Options</span>: When highlighted, copies the selections made for the topmost new placeholder or collection line to any beneath it. It is not necessary to un-highlight this option to deviate from the selections made in the topmost placeholder line. Edit as normal and the button un-highlights automatically.</p>
                <p> The default behavior is to save the state of the button (whether selected or not) when the view is exited. For example, if the <span class="Emphasis">Mirror Options</span> button is selected when the view is exited, then the button is selected (highlighted) the next time the view displays.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Current Collection</span>: (Placeholder view only) When highlighted, automatically sets the <span class="Emphasis">Coll Code</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Coll Desc</span> columns for newly created placeholders to the values for the collection of the placeholder that was selected when the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen was launched.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Historical</span>: Flips the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> sections in the view.</p>
                <p>The dynamic of assigning historical variants to placeholders is essentially the same regardless of the layout. Be aware that while a single historical variant can be assigned to many current placeholders,  only one variant can be mapped to a current placeholder when assigning in reverse. (If a blend of multiple variants is desired to seed rate of sale for a placeholder, the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale Calculator</span> can be used.)</p>
                <p>Placeholders that are Inactive or in Committed status will not be shown in the Current section of the view.</p>
                <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Rate of Sale Calculator.htm">Rate of Sale Calculator View</MadCap:xref>. </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Parameters</span>: Shows or hides the data selection parameters for the view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Parameter options are the same as in the main planning view defaulting to the same product, site, and cluster set selections as in the main view. <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> defaults to the <span class="Emphasis">LY</span> equivalent of the time selected in the main view.</p>
        <p>Data selection parameters only determine the variants/placeholders that populate in the <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> section of the view. Current placeholders are populated based on those shown in the main planning view.</p>

        <h2>Historical section</h2>
        <p>This section displays the placeholders and variants contained within the <span class="Emphasis">Product</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Site Hierarchy</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameters. Rows in this section can be dragged onto new placeholders or collections in the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section.</p>
        <p>The label <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> is a generic term that is based on the selected parameter. Placeholders and variants from any time frame can be displayed here.</p>
        <p>All metrics in this section are essentially the same as their <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section counterparts except that none are editable when the standard view configuration is engaged (meaning the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section on the left and the <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> section is on the right).</p>
        <h3>When the Historical Section is on the left</h3>
        <p>This is achieved by clicking the <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> button on the toolbar. The <span class="Emphasis">Attrib Copy</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Mod Factor</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Comp Start</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Comp End</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Adj ROS ($)</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Adj ROS (U)</span> fields become part of the Historical section.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Map to</span>: Selects a placeholder from those in the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section with compatible product levels to map the item to as a <span class="Emphasis">Like Style</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This field functions very similarly to the <span class="Emphasis">Map From</span> field except that each placeholder in the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section can only be selected as a <span class="Emphasis">Map to</span> once in the Historical section, as this view is not capable of mapping multiple items to a single placeholder. To blend multiple items together for the purpose of seeding rates of sale, users must use the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale Calculator</span> supporting view. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Rate of Sale Calculator.htm">Rate of Sale Calculator View</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Users can also drag and drop placeholders from the <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> section to set the <span class="Emphasis">Map to</span>. If the placeholder being dropped is already selected as the <span class="Emphasis">Map To</span> for another line in the <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> section, it is removed from that line and set as the <span class="Emphasis">Map To</span> for the new line.</p>
