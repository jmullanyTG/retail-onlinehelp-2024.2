        <h1>Commitment orders </h1>
        <p>Commitment orders can be created for one placeholder or collection at a time within the Assortment Planning module by using the <span class="Emphasis">Create Commitments</span> button within the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> supporting view. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Order Manager</span> module can be used to create commitment orders from assortment plans for entire sections of the product and site hierarchies and windows of time at once. (To initiate the creation of new commitment orders in Order Manager, click the <span class="Emphasis">Commitment</span> button in the top toolbar.)</p>

        <h2>Supplemental commitments</h2>
        <p>Supplemental commitments can be made  during a period within which an existing commitment order already exists. These additional commitment orders are supplemental and are neither an update nor a replacement. The ability to create a supplemental commitment is controlled by the <span class="Emphasis">Allow supplemental commitments</span> system policy.</p>
