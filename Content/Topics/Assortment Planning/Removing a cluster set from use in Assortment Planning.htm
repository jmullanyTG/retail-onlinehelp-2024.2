        <h1>Removing cluster sets from use in Assortment Planning</h1>
        <p>Permanently deleting a cluster set and all its related data is time and effort intensive. Additionally, a lot of data that later might be useful in aggregations or analysis is removed.  There are other options that are easier to achieve while retaining potentially valuable data. </p>
        <p>The other options are:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Phase out assortments to all the sites in the Cluster set.  </p>
                <p>Set the phase out date to soon before selling ceases at the sites in the Cluster set, and there will be no more active variants in the Cluster set.  This keeps the history of the activity in the Cluster Set for rollups and comparisons, but there won't be any future planning for the Cluster Set.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove assortments to all the sites in the Cluster set. </p>
                <p> Open the Cluster Details pane and uncheck the assortment into the Cluster Set.  This effectively deletes the association of placeholder to cluster in AP, so this data is no longer actualized or included in reports, comparison data, and etc. throughout AP.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove the cluster set from Hierarchy Defaults.  </p>
                <p>This will mean that the cluster set is no longer selectable in the different screens, and is not be included by default for any newly created placeholders.

</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Any combination of the above three options can be performed.</p>
