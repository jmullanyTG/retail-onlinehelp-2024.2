        <h1>Creating or selecting a ROS scenario</h1>
        <p>Using the parameters and controls at the top and at the far left of the view, users can either select a saved rate of sale scenario to apply to the placeholders/collections selected in the main planning view, and edit that scenario as desired, or define the inputs for an entirely new scenario.</p>
        <h2>The difference between Sales Type and Price Type</h2>
        <p>Sales Types define the larger bucket of sales from which to draw. Price Type is an optional data point that can change by period and can be used to further limit the data selection for the scenario.</p>
        <p>For example, it is possible to include the Sales Type Markdown but then further limit that data by setting a Price Type of Clearance and a Max Price Discount of 75% to only capture variants that had the Clearance Price Type and selling prices that were no more than 75% the original ticket price for each period in the scenario time frame.</p>
        <h2>Creating a new scenario</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select Variants and Sites as required:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Select an existing placeholder/variant filter or create a new filter to select the items for the scenario (this determines which scenarios will appear after scenarios have been created and saved)</li><li>Select an existing site filter or create a new filter to select the sites for the scenario (for application in assortment planning, select (All Sites)</li></ol></li>
            <li>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span> button.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Add</span> button to create a new scenario.</p>
                <p>This resets the parameters at the left to their defaults to allow for a new scenario but does not alter any saved scenario that was selected previously. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> to calculate the scenario lines.</li>
        </ol>
