        <h1>Assortment By Site Report</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Assortment By Site Report</span> is used to review sales and receipts information by site, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cluster Set / Cluster membership</li>
            <li>Site status</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of sales plan</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of receipt plan</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of EOP units</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Assignment By Site Report.PNG" class="LargeImages" /></p>
        <p>The right hand section displays the split of a sales plan by site with the data being for each Placeholder, as well as aggregates. This section shows: <span class="Emphasis">Selling Period</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Sales Units Share</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Total Orders Units</span> (Receipts + Committed + On Order), <span class="Emphasis">EOP Units Share</span>, and the <span class="Emphasis">Contribution Percent</span> used to derive the shared units values. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Contribution Percent uses the same LY contribution values as site exclusions and AUR/AUT weighting values.  If there is no contribution percent, then an even split is used. </p>
