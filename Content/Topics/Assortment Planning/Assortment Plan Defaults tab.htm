        <h2>Accounting for new store openings through the life of items  

</h2>
        <p>Two metrics account for new store openings through the life of items.  The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">New Site Min Pres Multiplier</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">New Site Multiplier Number of Periods</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This  functionality increases the safety stock (Minimum Presentation or Minimum Display) at particular points during the life of the item by front loading or ordering more stock earlier to account for new store openings.  The increase in safety stock occurs at each flow date, instead of at the beginning of the life of the item.  Additionally, instead of applying a multiplier for all sites, a multiplier is only applied for the count of new sites.

</p>
        <p class="Important">To function as designed and apply the multiplier for the count of new sites only, it is crucial that the <span class="Emphasis">Date Opened</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Date Closed</span> fields be accurate within Site Manager.</p>
        <h2>Field descriptions</h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Path Code</span>: The code for the corresponding level of the product hierarchy assigned to the current plan.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Path Description</span>: The full description of the product hierarchy path corresponding to the Path Code of the product hierarchy assigned to the current plan.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span>: The default cluster sets assigned to new placeholders generated within the specified level of the product hierarchy. Also, sets (along with <span class="Emphasis">Additional Allowed Cluster Sets</span>) the cluster sets that will be available in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> parameter when the associated product level is chosen. Available choices are only cluster sets which have been snapshotted and passed validation for use within the current assortment plan.</p>
        <p>The following message displays upon clicking <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> when users attempt to assign multiple cluster sets containing overlapping sites to a single level of the product hierarchy:</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Overlapping Site Assignments Warning.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>

Cluster sets selected here are not automatically assigned to new placeholders. Available choices are only cluster sets which have been snapshotted and passed validation for use within the current assortment plan. </p>
        <p> If users attempt to assign multiple cluster sets containing overlapping sites to a single level of the product hierarchy, an error message appears.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Minimum Presentation</span>: Sets the minimum presentation stock in units per site for a given period within the current assortment plan.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This setting persists across time for any periods for which <span class="Emphasis">Minimum Presentation</span> has not been set in the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults By Time</span> tab, with values entered there acting as overrides to this value.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Seasonality Curve</span>: Sets the default seasonality curve applied to placeholder instances generated within the specified level of the product hierarchy.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Curves Available for Selection in AP.flsnp" />
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Curve Mode</span>: Sets the mode of the seasonality curve being applied to a placeholder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Static</span>: The selected curve is applied exactly as it exists at the time of application and the placeholder’s curve will not change if changes are made to the curve, whether manually in the Curves module or through dynamic recalculation. Think of this as making a copy of the applied curve</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Dynamic</span>: Changes made to the curve are pushed down to the placeholder and the dependent sales plans recalculates when those changes are pushed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Lead Time Days</span>: The number of days prior to a given receipt date that an order must be placed to arrive on time. </p>
        <p> Used to calculate Next Order Date in the main planning and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> views and <span class="Emphasis">Due Date</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Upcoming Commitments</span> report for placeholders belonging to the corresponding product hierarchy level for which commitment orders have not been created and which either don’t have variants assigned or their assigned variants lack supplier association.                       </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Number of Markdown Periods</span>: The time frame for the markdown date to phase out date. </p>

        <p class="BasicNote">AUT is assumed to be inclusive of the Home Site VAT rate for the purpose of all calculations within Assortment Planning. For companies in which VAT is not in play for the home currency assigned to the active assortment plan, no special actions are required as long as the associated VAT % is set to zero. Alternatively, the system policy that enables the use of VAT in AUT calculations can be disabled. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Currency and VAT Management/Currency and VAT Management Overview.htm">Currency and VAT Management Overview</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly">For more information, refer to the Currency and VAT Management User Guide. </MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <p>    Actual by period constraint is defined as the sales planned for this many periods forward from a given period.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This setting interacts with the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Engine DC-to-Cluster Lead Time</span> (Maintain &gt; Policies &gt; Engine: Commitments).</p>
        <p class="Example"><span class="Emphasis">Assortment Engine DC-to-Cluster Lead Time</span> is set to 7 days. <span class="Emphasis">Periods of Supply</span> is set to 2 with a user planning a receipt to arrive in Wk 1. </p>
        <p>For this constraint to be considered fulfilled for Wk 1, the period must end with at least 60 units of inventory on hand to cover weeks 2 and 3. The lead time of 7 days stipulates that stock being received in given week cannot be used to cover the sales planned in that week. Thus, Periods of Supply begins calculating need at Wk 2 rather than Wk 1.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">This constraint can also be set in the Placeholder Constraints area of Receipt Plan view.</p>
        <p class="Important">The system always rounds up to meet Order Multiple constraints. This ensures that the base sales plan on which the receipt plan is built will always be satisfied.</p>
        <p>The following is a common scenario where very small parts are sold individually but it is not practical to ship them that way. For a sales plan of 241 units for weeks 1-4, and an Order Multiple of 50 set, the receipt quantity is 250 units or the lowest multiple of 50 that satisfies the entire sales plan.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Size Curve</span>: The size curve assigned to placeholders generated within the specified level of the product hierarchy for the current plan. Works in conjunction with <span class="Emphasis">Rec Size Min</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view and passed to Order Manager for use in the <span class="Emphasis">Break by Size</span> stage of the commitment process.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">All available size curves populate for selection in this field.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Periods Before Phase In</span>: The default number of periods prior to Phase In date that initial receipt quantities for placeholder instances should be scheduled to be received. Used in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> supporting view on the main planning view. For example, a placeholder with a Phase In date of wk 4 and a <span class="Emphasis">Periods Before Phase In</span> of 2 has a default calculated initial receipt for the placeholder of wk 2.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Flow Cadence</span>: The default number of periods between receipt dates calculated by the receipt planning engine. Used in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> supporting view on the main planning view.</p>
        <p class="Example">A placeholder with a Phase In date of wk 3, a Periods Before Phase In of 2, and a Flow Cadence of 4.  3 receipts will occur in wk 1, wk 7, and wk 11. </p>
        <p>This is because the purpose of <span class="Emphasis">Periods Before Phase In</span> is to ensure product can be in stores by the Phase In date. Thus, the first flow date is considered to be the Phase In date for the purposes of receipt engine calculation.<p><span class="Emphasis">Min Stk/Sales</span>: (Minimum Stock to Sales) Editable to 2 decimal places. The minimum stock to sales ratio for placeholder instances as a minimum stock constraint for receipt engine outputs within the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> supporting view on the main planning view. Actual by period constraint is defined as the sales planned for a given period multiplied by the constraint value (period sales of 10 * Min Stk/Sls of 4 = EOP stock requirement of 40).</p><p><span class="Emphasis">Shrink % of Sales</span>: Sets the anticipated shrink units per period as a percentage of planned period sales units for placeholder instances as a minimum stock constraint for receipt engine outputs within the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> supporting view on the main planning view. </p><p>For example, a period with planned sales of 500 units and a <span class="Emphasis">Shrink % of Sales</span> of 2.00% must have an EOP units of at least 10 for this constraint to be satisfied for the period.</p></p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Maximum Pack % Total</span>: Defines the maximum % of units in a commitment order of the units within prepacks can represent as a constraint for the prepack optimization engine within Order Manager. When set to less than 100%, units not placed in prepacks are fulfilled as single units.</p>
        <p class="Example">For two placeholder orders for wk 4 for 500 units each, prepacked together they have a <span class="Emphasis">Maximum Pack % Total</span> of 60.00%, the maximum number of units existing in prepacks for this order is 600. However, the prepack output could be less than 600 if the prepack configurations being used don’t evenly roll up to 600 units based on the need calculation by site.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Pack Tolerance</span>: The number of units over the total order quantity the engine may suggest in an attempt to fulfill the <span class="Emphasis">Maximum Pack % Total</span>, expressed as a percentage of the total order quantity. Used as a constraint for the prepack optimization engine within Order Manager</p>
        <p class="Example">For a total order quantity of 1,000 units to be prepacked, a <span class="Emphasis">Maximum Pack % Total</span> of 100%, and a <span class="Emphasis">Pack Tolerance</span> of 1.00%, the engine may suggest an adjustment of the total order quantity of up to 1010 units to allow for 100% of the original order quantity to be fulfilled by units in prepacks.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">When calculating prepack optimization against a Pack Tolerance, the engine will prioritize stores with greater need first</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Maximum Packs Per Location</span>: The maximum number of prepacks of any configuration that can be allocated to a single site within the prepack optimization calculation to fulfill the anticipated sales for that site. Used as a constraint for the prepack optimization engine within Order Manager</p>
        <p class="Example">The prepack optimization engine determines that a site requires 50 units from an order being prepacked, <span class="Emphasis">Maximum Packs Per Location</span> is set to 5, and the selected prepack configurations all contain 9 units - ignoring site need by size for this example, the engine can only use 5 prepacks, containing 45 units total, as the prepack component of order fulfillment for the site and must assume the remaining 5 units will be fulfilled as single units.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Underage Weight</span>: Sets the relative preference for underages when calculating optimal unit allocation by site. This is used as a constraint for the prepack optimization engine within Order Manager.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Used in conjunction with <span class="Emphasis">Overage Weight</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Pack Weighting</span> and calculated as a % to total of the 3 parameters (i.e. all 3 are summed then divided by the number of constraints that were not NULL.

        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">The system retrieves all Sites associated with the selected placeholder and a size curve for each Site is calculated. The individual Site size curves are rolled up to the placeholder level and re-normalized to give an overall placeholder size curve. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">The system assigns the smallest % a value that corresponds to the hierarchy default Pack Type Smallest Size Quantity. The rest of the size quantities are extrapolated from this. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">The system multiplies the initial Pack Quantity by 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 to give a range of Pack options to be used. The system suggests a Pack that is below the Max Weeks of Cover, below the Max Cost Ratio, and has the lowest error rate. If no Pack fits these requirements, then the Pack with the Multiplier that corresponds to Pack Type Default Multiplier.</p>
        <p>For example, for S M L where S = 20% M = 30% L = 50%. When calculating the pack, size S receives the Smallest Size Quantity and the other 2 sizes are calculated from that.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Pack Type Default Multiplier</span>: This is used as a tie break, if the system cannot select a Pack then the pack with the Multiplier corresponding to this value is selected. Valid values are 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5.</p>

        <p><span class="Emphasis">Min Presentation Multiplier</span>: Multiplies the minimum presentation units quantity passed into the receipt engine by the value entered in this field for the number of weeks specified in <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres Multiplier Number of Periods</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Min Presentation Multiplier</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres Multiplier Number of Periods</span> together have an effect on the receipt plan by weighting stock received toward the beginning of the receipt plan according to the values set.</p>
        <p class="Example"><span class="Emphasis">Min Presentation Multiplier</span> is set at 2.5 and <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres Multiplier Number of Periods</span> is set to 5. If the minimum presentation is 15, then the minimum presentation is raised to 37.5 for the first 5 weeks.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Min Pres Multiplier Number of Periods</span>: The number of periods that the multiplier is in effect from the phase-in date. A value of zero means effectively there is no multiplier. Once the number of periods has expired the minimum presentation values return to the original value.</p>
        <p>As the item starts actualizing, the number of periods declines until it is zero. Therefore, if the multiplier is to be used over the first 3 periods of a receipt plan, then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before phase in, wk1, wk2, and wk3 all use the multiplier.</li>
            <li>When wk1 is actualized and the current week is wk2, then wk2 and wk3 will use the multiplier.</li>
            <li>When wk2 is actualized and the current week is wk3, only wk3 will use the multiplier.</li>
            <li>When it is wk4 or later, the multiplier is no longer used, even though 3 periods continues to be the <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres Multiplier Number of Periods</span> value set.</li>
