        <h1>Placeholder and collection view parameters</h1>
        <p>The following parameters are available in the Placeholder and Collection views.</p>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>Selects a product filter for the current view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters.png" class="IconInline" />&#160; Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Filter Conditions</span> dialog allowing users to edit the criteria for the selected filter prior to executing it. The option also exists to create a new filter from the adjusted criteria.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Parameters_1.png" class="IconInline" />&#160; Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Filter</span> dialog allowing users to create or import a new filter, or update, delete, or export an existing filter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Placeholder metadata and cluster&#160;metadata must be distinguished when creating or editing product filters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Placeholder metadata fields are prefixed with <span class="Emphasis">Placeholder-</span> and apply to the total placeholder. </p>
                <p>For example, filtering by Placeholder - Total Sales (Rev) compares the filter criteria against the total combined sales revenue of all clusters that the placeholder is assorted to. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cluster metadata fields are prefixed with <span class="Emphasis">Cluster-</span> and apply at the individual cluster level. When filtering by these fields, the filter criteria is compared to each assorted cluster individually. If any cluster meets the filter criteria, the placeholder is included in the filter. For example, filtering by <span class="Emphasis">Cluster- Total Sales (Rev)</span> compares the filter criteria against the total sales revenue of each individual cluster  the placeholder is assorted to. If any cluster meets this criteria, the placeholder is included in the filter. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given sufficient permissions, it is possible for users to change the Product Level assignment or other properties of a placeholder causing it to no longer meet the criteria specified by the selected product filter. This causes the placeholder to disappear from the current view after clicking <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span>. To view the placeholder,  change the filter selection or adjust the filter’s criteria to include it again.</p>
        <h2>Site Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Selects the levels of the current Plan’s Site Hierarchy to include in the current view</p>
        <h2>Cluster Sets</h2>Selects the cluster sets to include in the current view. The cluster sets listed include all default and additionally available cluster sets for the product level selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Product</span> parameter. 
      
        <p>To assist users within organizations that have a large number of cluster sets in use in a given assortment plan, an additional filterable field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Product</span>, has been included in this dropdown. This column displays the product levels to which each cluster set is available to as either a default or additionally available cluster set. </p><p>While cluster sets are not explicitly part of the Site Hierarchy they are directly related. Cluster sets in a given assortment plan must be contained within a single lowest level of that hierarchy resulting in the Cluster Set dropdown populating with the cluster sets contained beneath the selected Site Hierarchy levels.</p><p>Regardless of whether any of the placeholders or collections returned by  Product, Site Hierarchy, and Window of Time selections are currently assorted to the cluster sets selected, the cluster sets will still show in the Cluster Details view, thus allowing users to assort to them.</p><p class="Important">For placeholders or collections to display in the main planning view, they must be currently assorted to at least one of the cluster sets selected in this dropdown. Therefore, to expand a placeholder to a cluster set it is not currently assorted to, select both a currently assorted cluster set and the one to expand to so the placeholder is visible. Then show the cluster details to assort it to the new cluster set. Once assorted, remove the originally assorted cluster set from the view parameters if needed.</p><p class="BasicNote">An error message displays if a user tries to un-assort the last assorted cluster from a placeholder.</p><h2>Window of Time</h2><p>Selects the window of time to display in the current view. </p><p class="BasicNote">Any placeholder or collection whose life cycle intersects with any part of the selected Window of Time displays in the view. This lets users work with placeholders and collections holistically. &#160;Displaying subdivisions of a life cycle might alter users decisions  if they have forgotten or are unaware of the full length of time a placeholder or collection is for sale.</p><h2>Display Currency</h2><p>Sets the currency to display for all revenue based fields in the view. This defaults to the Home Currency for the active Assortment Plan.</p><h2>View Selection</h2><p>Selects the supporting views to be enabled within Assortment Planning. Deselecting views that will not be used helps improve system performance by eliminating the need to store them in memory. </p><p class="BasicNote">This also reduces the number of active system handles, if there are errors regarding the number of handles currently in use or red <span class="Emphasis">X</span> marks across supporting views when they launch.</p><h3>Displaying or hiding view options in Placeholder and Collection modes</h3><p>System policy <span class="Emphasis">Hidden Items on the View Selection dropdown</span> (Module: Assortment) defines which view options display in the <span class="Emphasis">View Selection</span> parameter dropdown. </p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Selection choices.png" class="LargeImages" /></p><p>For more information on individual supporting views, see <MadCap:xref href="Supporting Views.htm">Supporting Views</MadCap:xref>.</p><p class="Important">This setting is currently global for the plan and not specific to each user, thus deselecting views affects other users’ ability to see them. Only super users or system administrators should be given permissions to modify View Selection to help avoid issues.</p><h2>Cluster Snapshot Date</h2><p>The list of snapshots displayed in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Snapshot Date</span> parameter is normally restricted by the dates selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter. For example, selecting a small window of time restricts the list by the start and end dates selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter.</p><p class="BasicNote">To see all available snapshots for the plan including those outside the selected Window of Time, system policy <span class="Emphasis">Return all Cluster Set Snapshot Dates</span> should be set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>.</p></body>
