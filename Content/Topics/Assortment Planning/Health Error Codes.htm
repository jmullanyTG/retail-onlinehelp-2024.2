It is important that actual data is up-to-date in AP before making any subsequent changes to sales plans.</td>

Since Total Sales represents the lifetime of the item, adding Actualized Sales and Future Sales together, Total Sales should always be the greater number. This circumstance would only occur if there were some unexpected data condition (like extremely negative sales values in actualized data); there are many defenses in the application to prevent this from happening.</td>

The Actualized Sales and Total Sales values can exactly match (and these values should match after the item has phased out), but there can be conflicts if entering in the exact Actualized Sales value into Total Sales and there are unrounded decimals not visible in the screen, so the value should be increased by 1.</td>

A sales, receipt, and inventory plan cannot exist where there are no sites.</td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyD-Column1-Body1">There are multiple actions to take to resolve this error. Reevaluate the cluster set snapshots over time, ensuring that all clusters have the right membership of sites. Reevaluate site status information, ensuring at least one site is open for each period of time during the life of the placeholder. If the cluster is truly meant to have no sites for some time (because, for example, a cluster has been removed or added), then change the AP plan to exclude the time where the cluster doesn't exist. This can be done by changing phase dates of the placeholder to not include the periods where the cluster is empty, or un-assorting from the cluster altogether using the Cluster Details pane.</td>

This process prunes old data out of data tables in order to reclaim space in the database.

A Markdown phase this long is unexpected in AP data.</td>

If all periods were opted out in error, then the user should opt some periods back in as selling. If the periods are marked as non-selling due to having no sites in the cluster, then actions should be taken to correct cluster definitions (see the Cluster Zero Site Count error). If the item is meant to not be in phase yet, set the phase dates accordingly.

If the policy is set, any Sales Units value between 0 and this threshold (e.g. 0.0001) is meant to be zeroed out. We cannot allow very-near-zero numbers in Sales Units, because Sales Units is often a divisor, e.g. AUR = Sales / Sales Units. If a very small number is used as a divisor, the resulting quotient will be extremely large, breaking the numeric limits of the application.</td>
