        <h1>Placeholder and collection view toolbar functionality </h1>
        <p>The Placeholder and Collection views are where the majority of work in Assortment Planning is done. Expandable side and bottom pane views provide access to core functionality that can be quickly configured on one or more screens and then saved as work spaces for quick recall later. This allows visibility to the core of a plan to be maintained, including product images. The effect of changes can be seen at different levels of the plan as they are made.</p>
        <p>Placeholders help  plan the items before the details of these items are officially known, such as color and style. Use placeholders to plan the financial target and build the sales projection.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholder Collection Modes.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The following are available on the toolbar:</p>
        <h2>New </h2>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholders</span> dialog (The <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholder</span> dialog is available in the Collection view via the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> supporting view). For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Generating placeholders.htm">Add Placeholders dialog</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Use the Style Bank view to link variants to placeholders. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Style Bank.htm#Assignin">Assigning variants</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2>Hindsight </h2>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen in Placeholder view and the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Collection Management</span> screen in Collection view. For more information on the Hindsight functionality, see <MadCap:xref href="Hindsight management.htm">Hindsight management</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Copy </h2>
        <p>(not available in Collection view) Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Copy Placeholder</span> dialog. Any placeholders not in a locked or <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> status can be copied. Copied placeholders are created in <span class="Emphasis">Open</span> status. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If the placeholder has a Health Error (something is wrong with the data), then the <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span> button is disabled.</p>

        <h3>Exceptions to exact duplication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the original item is Assigned or above, the Variant assignment is not copied into the duplicate. All data associated with a variant is not duplicated:<ul><li>Actualized sales, receipts, SOH</li></ul><ul><li>Planned orders from Order Manager or imported supplier order data</li></ul><ul><li>If the status of the original is Replen or Allocate, the Replenishment or Allocation links are not duplicated. For Replen items, the sales total will duplicate, but the sales plan (e.g. how that sales total is distributed across weeks) will not necessarily duplicate. This is recalculated according to the seasonality curve.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Receipt data is not copied. This must be regenerated by the engine.<ul><li>Receipt AUC is a weighted average by receipt units. Since receipt units are generated by the engine, the weightings may differ and thus AUC might be slightly different between original and duplicate.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Promotions are not duplicated. If <span class="Emphasis">Add to Promos?</span> is selected, the new duplicate evaluates all promotions it could be a part of and adds them. This would include any Promotions created since the original placeholder was created. Therefore, the copy’s promotion membership may or may not match original’s promotion membership.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Split</h2>
        <p>(not available in Collection view) Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Split Placeholders dialog</span>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Split Placeholders dialog.htm">Split Placeholders dialog</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Assign</h2>
        <p>Variants can be automatically imported and assigned from MS Excel spreadsheets or from the Clipboard. This functionality significantly reduces the time and repetitive work required to make Variant information (descriptions, color, vendor style code, costs, etc) from Vendors available in AP.</p>
        <p>To import, click the <span class="Emphasis">Assign</span> button on the toolbar and select one of the options on the dropdown. </p>
        <p>

The menu option <span class="Emphasis">Unassign Selected</span> unassigns variants attached to the selected placeholder rows. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not available at header level in Collection view. Available in Placeholder view or Variant view of Collection view.</li>
            <li>If any product attributes were attached to the variants being unassigned, the system reverts the overwritten attribute values back to their pre-variant assignment states.</li>
            <li>Variants cannot be unassigned variants from placeholders in Committed status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">The import functionality functions in the same way as the <span class="Emphasis">Import Excel Data</span> menu option in Order Manager.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Variants and PLM Codes to be assigned must exist in the Style Bank.</li>
            <li> The Placeholders being assigned must be eligible for Variant and PLM Code assignment (i.e. Active and not Locked, not in Status <span class="Emphasis">Allocation</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Committed</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> and not actualized).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is possible to reassign Placeholders from one PLM&#160;code to another as long as the placeholder is not committed or actualized.</p>
        <h2>Delete</h2>
        <p>Deletes all selected placeholder or collection rows. To undo, use <span class="Emphasis">Undo &gt; Deletions</span> rather than <span class="Emphasis">Cancel</span>. Deletions are permanent after clicking <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. Committed placeholders and collections cannot be deleted.</p>
        <h2>Commitments</h2>
        <p>Allows users to create Commitments in bulk. There are two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Selected</span>: Attempts to create Commitments for all highlighted rows (Placeholder Collections / Placeholders).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">All</span>: Attempts to create Commitments for all rows.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Grouping commitments</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Commitments by Group.flsnp" />
        <h2>Undo</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Undo</span> sub-menu has the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Selected Row Changes</span>: Reverts unsaved changes for the selected rows only. Use this when there are changes to multiple rows but only certain rows should be undone. Using Cancel undoes all changes.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Deletions</span>: Undoes all deletions of placeholder or collection rows. Use this method instead of clicking <span class="Emphasis">Cancel</span> to undo row deletions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Locations</h2>
        <p>Launches the Manage Locations window (not available in Collection view). Use this dialog to exclude specific sites from clusters to which a placeholder is assorted and adjust their sales plans accordingly. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Manage Locations dialog.htm">Manage Locations dialog</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>View Options</h2>
        <p>The following options can be selected:</p>

                <p>The re-trending of ROS is a valuable tool to consider for products as they transition from a pre-season plan to in-season. As products begin to sell, their sales patterns inevitably trend away from the initial plan (sometimes in the positive, sometimes in the negative). The included re-trend mechanisms in the application account for the trends in sales and form an amended go-forward sales plan against which continued allocations may be structured. </p>
                <h4>Reviewing the results of running the Retrend logic</h4>

        <h2>Workspaces</h2>
        <p>Within Assortment Planning, users can create and save workspaces. Workspaces are configurations of visible views which enable particular tasks such as setting (and saving a workspace with) Placeholder, Style Bank, and Cluster Sets views docked and visible to support Cluster Assortment planning.
