        <h1>Manipulating placeholders and collections</h1>
        <h2>Grouping by columns</h2>
        <p>Placeholders and collections can be grouped by clicking and dragging any column header to the grouping section at the top of this view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/PH Grouped By Columns.png" class="LargeImages" />

        </p>
        <h2>Placeholder/collection Locks</h2>
        <p> As many of the metrics within the main planning view are inter-dependent, it can be necessary to lock metrics for one or more placeholders within a collection or for the entire collection depending on what was changed until changes are saved.</p>
        <p>In this example, the placeholder was locked because Phase In was changed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Locking Placeholders.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Calculations</h2>
        <p class="BasicNote">When checking values, it should be understood that values are presented in a rounded state  for ease of display. Small differences in the actual calculated results may be present. In the database, all calculations are done with maximum precision to avoid unnecessary rounding.</p>
        <h2>Collection level checkboxes</h2>
        <p>checkboxes in <span class="Emphasis">Collection</span> view such as those in the <span class="Emphasis">Active</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Carryover</span> fields display a solid gold state <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Placeholders Within Collection Are Checked.png" class="IconInline" /> to indicate that only some placeholders within the collection are checked.</p>
        <h2>Reviewing pre-markdown and post-markdown metrics in Placeholder view</h2>
        <p>The following columns in Placeholder view allow users to review pre-markdown and post-markdown metrics:</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Changing a collection code</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <span class="Emphasis">PH&#160;Collection Code</span> field, double-click or right-click and select <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span>.</li>
            <li>In the dialog, select an existing code from the list and click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> or enter a new description in the <span class="Emphasis">Collection Desc</span> field and click <span class="Emphasis">New</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Changing a placeholder’s collection assignment recalculates both its prior Collection’s % and its newly assigned Collection’s % contribution for all placeholders that belong to either.</p>
        <h2>Changing placeholder/collection status of placeholders with replenishment data present</h2>
        <p>Changing placeholder/collection status of placeholders with replenishment data present (see <span class="Emphasis">Available for Replen</span>) to Replen displays the following:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/PH Controlled Replen Forecast Dialog.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span> irreversibly overwrites the sales plan for the changed item with available replenishment forecast data. While the change to the item Status can be reverted, the previous sales plan data is not maintained. The state of the sales plan at the time of the change, including metric values, cluster assignments, and location exceptions, become the go-forward sales plan, though the plan elements will become editable once more.</p>
        <h2>Changing placeholder/collection status of placeholders without replenishment data present</h2>
        <p>Changing placeholder/collection Status of placeholders without replenishment data present (see <span class="Emphasis">Available for Replen</span>) to Replen displays the following:</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/No Replen Data Available For PH Dialog.png" style="width: 537px;height: 239px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span> irreversibly zeros out the sales plan for the changed item. While the change to the item Status can be reverted, the previous sales plan data is not maintained. Plan metrics stay at zero though the plan elements are editable once more.</p>
        <h3>Notes on Replen items:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales plans for Replen items are updated nightly to coincide with updates to replenishment forecasts.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Replen item sales plans can also be updated on demand by clicking the <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate</span> button in the <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> section of the toolbar. However, this utilizes the settings of the most recent replenishment run. </p>
                <p>It is advisable to verify the output of the last replenishment run created using the same parameters as are used in the nightly run or the data brought into AP may be inconsistent or incomplete.</p>
            </li>
            <li>As only future data is ever written in a replenishment run and data is written daily, this requires the application to specially handle inter-period sales and on-hand inventory. BOP on-hand is created from actuals and not changed throughout the period. Sales and receipts are combined as "future periods from replenishment" and "past periods from actuals" to maintain a total period number throughout the period until it is fully actualized. EOP on-hand values always come from replenishment data.</li>
            <li>Certain plan elements still remain editable. Most are informational fields (PH Description and Code, Tags, Notes) but all Shrink/Inventory Adjustments metrics in Sales Plan View are editable.</li>
            <li>Replen items cannot be locked, made inactive, or deleted.</li>
            <li>Seasonality Curve, Size Curve, and Min Pres are cleared as these elements are controlled within the Forecasts module. If the status changes from <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> to something else, the item inherits the defaults set on the plan for the product level to which it belongs.</li>
            <li>Any Sales Plan and Receipt Plan overrides are irrevocably cleared.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Receipt Plan constraints are cleared as these elements are controlled within the Forecasts module. If the status changes from <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> to something else the item inherits the defaults set on the plan for the product level to which it belongs.</p>
                <p class="Important">Currently, Forecasts uses buckets and Assortment Planning uses periods. These are two different time entity types that do not have to align in order for Assortment Planning to read in replenishment forecast data. </p>
                <p>The application attempts to match the calendars in each module by cross referencing Forecast bucket start dates with the Assortment Planning periods beginning and ending dates. However, if the buckets and periods do not coincide, this may lead to sub-optimal data within Assortment Planning. </p>
                <p>For example, if the buckets in Forecasts are set to monthly and the periods in AP are weekly, AP puts the sales for the entire monthly bucket into the first weekly period available during that month, etc.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">In Collection view, displays the most advanced status of any placeholders within the collection (with Open being least and Replen being most advanced).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Visibility to actual ROS and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales </h2>
        <p>The ROS&#160;metric reflects a combination of actual and planned sales in a single ROS&#160;metric. The following metrics split actual and planned sales out. This provides better visibility to the actual ROS for  active sites and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reg Ftr Site Count, Reg Ftr ROS ($), Reg Ftr ROS (U), Reg Ftr Site ($), Reg Ftr Site (U), Reg Ftr AUR ($), Act ROS ($), Act ROS (U)</li>
            <li>SPV ROS ($), SPV ROS (U), SPV Sales ($), SPV Sales (U)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">If at any point a user makes a change causing Total Sales Units to change, this will cascade down to the Regular Future figures as well.</p>

        <h2>Supersessions in AP: Using an existing variant's EOP as the BOP for a subsequent variant</h2>
        <p>
            Supersessions let users forecast demand for new items with no sales history by using an existing variant's EOP as the BOP for the new item. </p>
        <p>Supersession relationships are defined in the Supersession module at the Item Master level (style-color-size) and best practice is to map all sizes to create a 1-to-1 relationship. If all sizes are not mapped, then the defined size curve for the placeholder is used to approximate the anticipated remaining units by size, for use by the supersession stock metrics. </p>
        <p>For multi-size variants, supersessions are defined by size, for each size. New supersessions and changes to existing supersessions are automatically pushed into AP.</p>
        <p>Typically, outside of the supersession functionality, AP is at the variant level (style-color) and does not consider size. </p>
        <h3>When not all sizes are mapped</h3>
        <p>For example, if a style is projected to end phase-out with 2,000 units left on hand, and only 3 of the 4 sizes are mapped with a supersession (S,M,L were mapped to a supersession style, but XL was not) and the size curve for that placeholder was defined as 30-40-20-10:</p>
        <p>The curve is applied against the remaining 2,000 units:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2,000*0.3 = 600 S</li>
            <li>2,000*0.4 = 800 M</li>
            <li>2,000*0.2 = 400 L</li>
        </ul>
        <p>meaning 600+800+400 = 1,800 units would be displayed under <span class="Emphasis">Supersession Stock Units</span> for the upcoming supersession style.</p>
        <p>The remaining 200 XL units (2,000*0.1) do not transfer to the new supersession style, as XL was not mapped.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if all sites are not mapped, historical site contribution is used to exclude the stock projected to be on-hand at unmapped sites.</p>
        <h3>Example of a supersession scenario</h3>
        <p>There are times when a new variant is close enough to an existing variant that the two variants are seen by customers as interchangeable. (For example, variant A = red socks with black squares, variant B = red socks with black circles.)</p>
        <p>In such a scenario, the stock on-hand position of the first can be considered when planning stock needs for the second variant. This is very useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>both items look very similar</li>
            <li>
                <p>variant B’s life cycle is after variant A’s life cycle and the user would like to use variant A’s EOP as variant B’s BOP</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Phase dates need to be considered when utilizing supersessions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>the supplier of an existing variant produces the same style each year, but changes the style-code/SKU in subsequent years</li>
            <li>when stock from one item should be considered towards stock for a subsequent item.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Viewing supersession details</h3>
        <p>Within AP, two metrics provide information at the placeholder level:</p>

                <p>Additionally, periods will only have an imported <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUC</span> value set if that value actually exists in price/cost data. It will not set all missing periods to zero.</p>

                <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> incorporates each of the following, all of which are individually controlled via system policy:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>It is important to see if this field is checked before changing the status of a placeholder or collection to <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span>. There is a warning if no data is present. However, checking first saves time. This is also useful for verifying that the replenishment forecast matches up with the assigned variants.</p>
                <p class="Important">This field is checked if ANY portion of the combination assigned variants, cluster sets, and product lifespan has a replenishment forecast against it. For example, the field is checked if a single item master related to the assigned variant has a forecast for a single site contained within the clusters that variant is assorted to during the lifespan of the variant. </p>

Placeholders in collections by themselves always have a percentage of 100%. When shifting placeholder collection assignments, percentages for all placeholders in affected collections are recalculated, but sales hold for all. When adjusting <span class="Emphasis">Collection % Cont</span> directly, collection level sales hold and placeholder sales recalculate.</p>
                <p>As changes are made to this metric within a collection, the <span class="Emphasis">% Locked</span> field is checked, so subsequent changes won’t alter  previous entries within the collection. The sum of <span class="Emphasis">Collection % Cont</span> for all placeholders in a collection must equal 100%. Entries are re-normalized that would cause the sum to exceed by dividing each by the sum of the percentages. </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Seasonality Curve Weight Factor</span>: When an Item has both a Seasonality Curve and a Lifecycle Curve, the Seasonality Curve Factor determines how the two curves influence the Sales Plan. A value of .5 means that the two curves each influence the Sales Plan 50% each. A value of .7 would mean that the Seasonality Curve is weighted at 70% and the Lifecycle Curve at 30%. The values for the two curves always add up to 100%. The Seasonality Curve Factor is only relevant if there is both a Seasonality Curve and a Lifecycle Curve. If only one curve is set, then any value in the Seasonality Curve Factor field does nothing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Typically, this metric is always a static whole number that equates to the sum of the cluster level site counts to which the placeholder/collection is assorted. However, when multiple cluster set snapshots are present during a placeholder or collection’s life, it is possible for site count by cluster to vary, thus necessitating the need for an average count.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Size Curve</span>: The size curve to apply to the placeholder or collection. Displays all defined size curves. Filter by typing in the Size Curve Option or Description fields. Use % to do a “Contains” filter condition rather than “Starts With” (for example, <span class="Emphasis">%Tops</span> returns everything containing the word <span class="Emphasis">Tops</span>).</p>
                <p>Applying at the collection level pushes a size curve down to all placeholders in a collection. The relevance of sizes contained in the applied curve to new placeholders cannot be validated.</p>

                <p class="BasicNote">Changes made in <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view do not directly affect the metrics in the main planning view with the exception of removing Selling Periods. These metrics are considered the System Plan when working in <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view.
