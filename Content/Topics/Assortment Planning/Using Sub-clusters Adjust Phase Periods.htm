        <h2>Assorting Plans to sub-clusters</h2>
        <p>Sub-clusters are selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> screen by clicking in the <span class="Emphasis">Additional Allowed Cluster Sets</span> field and selecting them. The <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Details</span> side pane allows users to manage the assortment of placeholders and collections to clusters and sub-clusters.</p>
        <p>It is possible to have regular cluster sets in the Plan as well, but these will appear as overlapping cluster sets. Placeholders cannot be assigned to both the cluster AND the specific sub-clusters.</p>
