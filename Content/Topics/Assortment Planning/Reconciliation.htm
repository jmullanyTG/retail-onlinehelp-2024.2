        <h1>Reconciliation </h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Reconciliation</span> screen within Assortment Planning Module allows organizations to aggregate their assortment plan data and reconcile key metrics that are set as targets within Merchandise Financial Planning.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">This report is a standard Pivot Grid set up. The one exception is that the parameters drive the product and site hierarchy selections and pivoting of those dimensions is not possible. To move up or down common levels of the product and site hierarchies between two plans, reselect the desired level of product and site in the <span class="Emphasis">Parameters</span> section of the view and hit <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span> for the data to refresh to the desired levels.</p>
        <p>Assortment plans  contain granular data related to the item plans of an organization, as it represents the detail behind what items are being bought, when items deliver, and the life cycle information for items related to Sales, Cost of Sales, Margin, Receipts, and Inventory ownership.&#160;This information can be leveraged within an organization to view plans at various aggregated levels of the product, site and time hierarchies.&#160;The aggregated information can be compared to financial targets set within Merchandise Financial Planning or assortment plan snapshots.</p>
        <p>The aggregation of assortment plan data at established levels of the product and site hierarchies over time provides insight to an organization and helps to guide the organization in decisions around merchandising, pricing and promotions, open to buy, profitability and inventory management.&#160; </p>
        <p>The information can be utilized to soft reconcile the aggregation of the plans within the Assortment module to levels of commonality within Merchandise Financial Planning as it pertains to the product, location and time hierarchies.&#160; Soft reconcile is a comparison of one set of plans against another for key metrics such as Sales, Sales Units, Cost of Sales, AUR, AUC, Margin, Margin %, Inventory in cost and units and receipts.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Reconciliation Report</span> contains all the foundational metrics related to the aggregation of sales, margin, receipt and inventory data up the product and location hierarchies defined in the active assortment plan.&#160;Future period plans and actualized data can be reviewed as well.&#160;&#160;Additionally, one of the key components of the Reconciliation lets users review the aggregated assortment plan data versus financial targets set for periods within a selected merchandise financial plan.</p>
        <p>The main intent of this report is to drive the plan review process in an iterative top-down (MFP) and bottom-up (AP) planning structure.&#160; The general idea in pre-season and in-season planning is to ensure that the Assortment plan is aggressive enough to achieve the targets set within Merchandise Financial planning. This can be done by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaluating whether enough demand is planned to achieve the sales targets set in MFP, additionally reviewing the inventory planned to support the demand.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the flow cadence of intake set up with the assortment plans regarding receipts and whether the cadence of deliveries is in line with the desired intake targets set in Merchandise Financial Planning.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Comparing the active assortment plan to any assortment plan snapshot that has been deemed important to an organization.</p>
                <p> For example, as a good hindsight activity, users could compare an original plan snapshot of the assortment plan to the active assortment plan at the end of the season to draw conclusions on the commitment process and whether the original plan the organization is buying to is accurate versus how the season is actually performing.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These activities may help to generate discussions around commitment strategies and shortening lead times in certain areas of the organization.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Important">Levels of commonality must exist for the foundational metrics to make sense in this view.</p>
