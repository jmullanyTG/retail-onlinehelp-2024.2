        <h1>Style Bank view</h1>
        <p>Where a product lifecycle management (PLM) or similar system is integrated with Assortment Planning, use the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view to quickly locate and assign variants to placeholders within a plan. The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view can only be used to assign variants to single placeholders at a time. The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view is available in both Placeholder and Collection modes. </p>
        <p>Add fields by right-clicking any column header, selecting <span class="Emphasis">Column Chooser</span>, and dragging the fields to the column header area.</p>
        <p>Depending on the structure of the assigned product hierarchy, product hierarchy fields are available to add to the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view to aid in identifying the desired styles. </p>
        <p>Product attribute fields can be added to the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view to assist in qualifying selections of items to assign to placeholders in the main planning view. Fields are available for all attribute families configured in the <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Management</span> tab of the Attribute Management module. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> Attribute family fields are available for inclusion regardless of whether actual values are assigned to the variants displayed. Thus, it is possible to add attribute family columns that are partially or entirely blank.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view includes all Attribute data types for the Variants, in both the main planning view and the docked view in the Collection view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Style Bank.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view populates all variants assigned to any product hierarchy levels that exist in the Product filter selection in the view parameters.</p>
        <h2>Filtering the list</h2>
        <p>To filter the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> by any column, type in the space provided below the header. Use <var>%</var> at the beginning to do a <i>Contains</i> type filter instead of a <i>Starts With</i> filter. More complex filters are applied by clicking the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Style Bank Complex Filters.png" class="IconInline" /> icon that appears when hovering the cursor over a column header and then clicking (Custom).</p>
        <h2>Displaying only relevant variants applicable to a selected placeholder</h2>
        <p>By default, the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view displays all variants regardless if they are within the selected product hierarchy. This can lead to a very large list to look through to find a desired style. </p>
        <p>If selected, a View Option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Active Style Bank</span> evaluates the contents of the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> based on the currently selected row in the main planning view. This option provides a much smaller relevant list of styles that would make sense to be applied to the selected placeholder. Double-click on a variant to assign it to the selected Placeholder.</p>
        <h3>Placeholder view</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/View Options dropdown.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Collection view</h3>
        <p>Select the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> supporting view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Active Style Bank Collection View.png" style="width: 675px;height: 205px;" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If <span class="Emphasis">Active Style Bank</span> has been selected, then the <span class="Emphasis">PLM Code</span> field acts as a dropdown and shows the same Variants as the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view. Alternatively, double-click a selection within the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Placeholder and collection view toolbar functionality.htm#AdvancedStyleBank">Advanced Style Bank</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>
            <a name="Assignin">
            </a>Assigning variants</h2>
        <p>To assign a variant, drag it from the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> and drop it on the desired placeholder line. The full hierarchy path of the variant to be assigned is verified against the path of the placeholder. The cursor changes to a circle with a diagonal line through it if there is a mismatch. In this case, the variant cannot be assigned to the placeholder.</p>
        <p>Variants that have already been assigned to placeholders in the current plan are conditionally formatted for easy identification (see the above screenshot for an example of this).</p>
        <p>The same variant cannot be assigned to two placeholders within a collection. However, it is possible to assign the same variant to two placeholders in the plan as long as they are assorted to different cluster sets. This is to allow for plan seeding via multiple <span class="Emphasis">Target Creation</span> scenarios for different areas of the site hierarchy that will share the same variants.</p>
        <p>A variant cannot be assigned over another variant of a placeholder in <span class="Emphasis">Committed</span> status.</p>
        <p class="Important">Assigning a variant may overwrite or add to any attributes already assigned to the target placeholder. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Attributes View.htm#Dual-dir">Dual-directional attribute flow</MadCap:xref>.</p>
