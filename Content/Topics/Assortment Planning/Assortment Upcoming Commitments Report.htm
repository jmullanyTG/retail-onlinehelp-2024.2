        <h1>Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard Report</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard Report</span> is an easy way to track key milestones in the commitment process for orders created from assortment plans and then quickly navigate to those orders to complete the next required steps.&#160; </p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> Planned receipts that have not yet had commitments created for them will still appear in this report. However, certain fields may be blank and the Due Date calculates based on the intended receipt date and the Default Lead Time Days assigned to the corresponding product.</p>

        <h2>Tracking created commitment orders</h2>
        <p>This report is essential to keeping track of created commitment orders and ensuring that the activities required to provide sufficient information to suppliers are completed on-time, thus ensuring on-time delivery of products. </p>
        <p>Efficient use of this report involves setting the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter to include a period from the current week to a number of weeks out based on how long ordering activities such as Break By Size and Prepack analysis normally take. </p>
        <p>If managerial approvals are required in an organization prior to submitting orders, then the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter selected should be increased to include the amount of time anticipated for review and any required changes.</p>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>The report is controlled by four parameters:</p>
        <p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Fields</h2>

            <li><span class="Emphasis">Order Date</span>: The date the corresponding order document was created. Set to the Due Date if no order has been created.</li>
