        <h2><a name="Defaults"></a>Defaults </h2>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> view for the current plan. Users can set default parameters for plan elements and functions used frequently within Assortment Planning so they do not have to be manually set each time. Default parameters can generally still be changed later by users if needed.</p>
        <p>Defaults set here are applied to placeholders assigned to the specified level of the product hierarchy at the time of generation, whether manually within the main planning view or through the Smart Start function.</p>
        <p>Defaults are set in an inheritance scheme, meaning defaults set at higher levels of the product hierarchy persist down through the levels beneath unless different defaults are set at those lower levels as exceptions.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Changing defaults in this screen does not alter settings for placeholders that already exist.</p>
        <p class="Example">A hierarchy has a department called Mens Tops. Beneath Mens Tops there are the sub-departments Mens Tees, Mens Wovens, and Mens Knits. A user sets a default at the Mens Tops level and then sets a different default at the Mens Knits level. Mens Tees and Wovens inherit the same default that was set at the Mens Tops level, but Men’ Knits uses the default set at its own level. All default settings are not required.</p>

        <h2><a name="Receipt"></a>Receipt Periods</h2>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Receipt Periods</span> view in which Receipt periods can be defined in a pivot table. The <span class="Emphasis">Manage Receipt Periods</span> view provides detailed visibility to how receipts are planned and provides a way to effectively manage Receipts at an aggregated hierarchy level with Receipt periods assigned to specific weeks. </p>
        <p>Receipt periods can be assigned at any level of the Product hierarchy and can be assigned to all underlying levels. Exceptions can be made on underlying levels in the hierarchy. Only those time periods selected using the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter populate the grid.</p>
        <p>The Receipt periods are applied to all existing Placeholders whose phase dates intersect with the selected time periods, and the defaults will be applied to all new placeholders created in the future.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">The default setting is determined by the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default Flow Date Type</span>.</p>
        <h3>Setting a default for all sub-categories of a hierarchy level</h3>
        <p>A default can be assigned at a higher level (for example, <span class="Emphasis">Coats &amp; Jackets</span>) and all lower levels are automatically set to that default. This saves having to configure many sub-categories. </p>
        <p>For example, to set <span class="Emphasis">Flow Date</span> as the default for all sub-categories of <span class="Emphasis">Coats &amp; Jackets</span> for a particular set of weeks, click on the Accessories label to highlight all the relevant fields. Within the grid, right-click and select the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> menu option to update multiple fields using the <span class="Emphasis">Multi Data Change Form</span>. This updates all the sub-categories simultaneously.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Period Mens Accessories.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, a particular hierarchy level can be collapsed by clicking on the arrow and set the default in the appropriate field in the grid.</p>
        <h3>Selections available by period</h3>
        <p>Once saved, the field selections act as defaults. This means anything created after the default was set inherits the default. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Existing items are not affected unless either <span class="Emphasis">Apply Visible, Saved Defaults to Existing Items</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Apply Visible, Saved Defaults Over User Overrides</span> is clicked.</p>
        <h3>Applying changes to existing items</h3>
        <p>The user can apply all Receipt Period defaults to all existing items by clicking one of the two buttons on the top of the screen. For both, users must click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> before the defaults on screen are applied.  If the user does not click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> before clicking an <span class="Emphasis">Apply</span> button, then the unsaved changes will not be in effect.</p>
        <p>The changes brought on by clicking these buttons only affect items in any of the hierarchy levels and cluster set / clusters currently displayed in the grid.</p>
        <p>If there are placeholders that are assigned to a parent hierarchy level but haven’t been assigned a final product level, then all placeholders assigned at that parent level are affected. For example, placeholders assigned to <span class="Emphasis">Mens &gt; Accessories</span> that have not been given a more specific assignment (Bags, Belts, etc) will be affected if the <span class="Emphasis">Mens &gt; Accessories</span> level is on the screen.</p>
        <p>The date selection parameter determines which placeholders are affected in terms of how their Phase dates overlap.  If any point of the life cycle of the placeholder intersects the selected Window of Time, then all flow dates for the planned life of that placeholder are updated, not just the periods being selected.</p>
        <p>Changes are applied to existing items in one of two ways:</p>

        <h2><a name="Seed"></a>Seed</h2>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Seed Placeholders</span> dialog. Because of the way placeholder entities are used within Assortment Planning, a necessary step in creating new plans is generating equivalent placeholder entities for existing items for which historical selling information is to be utilized.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Ideally, this process is performed once per plan as all new items created in Assortment Planning are generated as placeholder entities. However, the process can be re-run to pick up new items that weren’t present at the time of seeding without adversely affecting anything that has already been seeded. The process looks for variants that don’t have placeholder entities created and creates them.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Seed Placeholders View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Two system policies allow for the specification of custom user-friendly descriptions for placeholders and collections generated from the Seed process. A style description or variant description is still respectively appended at the end of the custom description as an indicator to the seed link (for example, ‘custom text from system policy’ + style or variant description). The two system policies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Description for Generated Placeholder Collections from Seed</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Description for Generated Placeholders from Seed</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Seeding and Attribute Inheritance</h3>
        <p>When seeding placeholders from historical variants, any attributes attached to those variants will also be attached to the resultant placeholders, provided the following are true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A valid attribute set is associated with the product level to which the variants belong. Association can be by directly choosing an attribute set for that level of the product hierarchy or through inheritance of a set from a level above.</li>
            <li>That attribute set is assigned to both the Variant and Variant Placeholder entity types.</li>
            <li>That attribute set includes all attribute families containing the attribute values associated with the variants placeholders are being created for.</li>
            <li>All applicable attribute families are assigned to both the Variant and Variant Placeholder entity types.</li>
            <li>All attribute values associated with the variants placeholders are being created for are marked as Allowed for the corresponding attribute set.</li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information on creating and assigning attribute sets, families, and values, see <MadCap:xref href="../Attribute Management/Attribute Management Overview.htm">Attribute Management and Assignment Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly">For more information, refer to the Attribute Management online help.</p>
        <h3>Seed Placeholders parameters</h3>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Start Date</span>: Sets the historical date the system begins at when generating placeholders for existing items. This should be set to the farthest date back desired to utilize historical sales in Assortment Planning. A general best practice is at least 2 years as most businesses typically view data this far back as being relevant to current plans.</p>
        <p class="Important">Start date cannot fall before the date designated by the current date minus the number of days specified in the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment days history to maintain</span> system policy (accessed via <span class="Emphasis">Maintenance &gt; Policies &gt; Module: Assortment</span>).</p>
        <h3>Seed Placeholders grid</h3>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Use Default Cluster Set(s) per product level</span>: This option appears at the top of the cluster set list and allows users to easily seed historical placeholders for the default cluster sets assigned by product level. For this option to work properly, at least one default cluster set must be assigned either directly or through inheritance from a level above for all product levels present in the plan being seeded. An error message displays indicating the need to do this if it has not been done at the time seeding is initiated.</p>
        <p>This option cannot be used in tandem with the selection of other cluster sets within the list. An error displays if there is an attempt to do so.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Due to the dynamic nature of cluster configurations, all that is needed here is to select the cluster sets that contain the sites where the items sold historically. Sales assignments are made at site level and returned based on the active cluster set snapshot for a given period.</p>
        <h2>Split Factors</h2>
        <p>Split factors are managed using the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Split Factors</span> screen within the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span> module. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Managing Split Factors.htm">Managing Split Factors</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Grid columns</h3>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set</span>: A read-only description for each validated cluster set within the current plan.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Overlapping Cluster Sets</span>: A read-only description for any validated cluster sets that overlap with a given cluster set (it contains some or all of the same sites as another set). While it is possible to have overlapping cluster sets within a single plan, it is not possible to assort placeholder items to multiple overlapping cluster sets. One cluster set per group of sites must be chosen in which to plan.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Current Placeholder Count</span>: A read-only count of all placeholder items currently generated that registered sales in a given cluster set from the Start Date forward.  </p>
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Refresh</span>: Refreshes the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> dialog.</p>

        <p><span class="Emphasis">Fields</span>: Opens the fields <span class="Emphasis">Customization</span> dialog. Users can drag fields to/from the Assortment Seed Placeholders column header area and this dialog to customize the view. Custom layouts can be saved/restored by right-clicking in the Assortment Seed Placeholders area and selecting <span class="Emphasis">Save Layout</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Restore Layout</span>, respectively.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Save</span>: Initiates the placeholder generation procedure for the selected cluster sets from the Start Date forward.</p>

        <p>The metric <span class="Emphasis">Projected Sales Units</span> is configurable.  Depending on how this metric is configured, the <span class="Emphasis">Projected Sales Units</span> line in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view populates from either Replen or External.</p>
