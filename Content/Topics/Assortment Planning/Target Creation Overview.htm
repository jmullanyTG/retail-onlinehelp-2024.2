        <h1>Target creation</h1>
        <p>Target Creation is the establishing of plan targets for specific areas of a business and the determining of the number of items required to meet those plan targets.
Assortment Planning has the ability to segment hierarchy levels by a wide array of product attributes, both qualitative and quantitative, and then further subdivide and define plan targets and desired new choice counts all the way down to a cluster level.</p>
        <p>Traditional assortment planning tools are typically rigid in that planning is by product and site hierarchy only. This has led to many retailers attempting to gain detail by further extending their hierarchies, but this approach still does not offer true flexibility to adjust strategy as often as desired based on the changing needs of the business.  </p>
        <p>Target Creation can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> create scenarios in as simple or complex as manner as desired.</li>
            <li>link scenarios to existing merchandise financial plans or base plan targets on specified historical period.</li>
            <li>define business segments by product hierarchy or based on a wide array of variables defined through product filters.</li>
            <li>model new areas of business, adjust percent contributions and plan targets at aggregate or more granular levels through the Pivot Grid functionality, and calculate recommended new choice counts based on targets through Rationalization (a marginal return curve calculation that suggests optimal assortment breadth and depth based on cleansed historical data).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scenarios can be used to create a foundation for assortment plans through a process called Smart Start. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Smart Start.htm">Smart Start </MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>Use the following parameters to filter the displayed Targets:</p>
