        <h1>Time Frame Overview</h1>
        <p>Time frames define the windows of time to use for an operation such as creating an Allocations product model or generating a demand forecast. Time frames are reusable across modules and shareable with other users. </p>
        <h2>Static and dynamic options</h2>
        <p>Create time frames based on static calendar dates (January 1 - December 31) or on date ranges that dynamically update on a rolling basis (last 180 days, next 90 days, and so on) </p>
        <h2>Support for multiple time periods</h2>
        <p>Create time frames that span multiple time ranges. For example, a time frame that covers each January for the years 2021-2023. That time frame would include the following distinct date ranges: January 1-31, 2021, January 1-31, 2022, January 1-31, 2023.</p>
        <h2>Schedules support</h2>
        <p>For convenience, base a time frame on  schedules created in the Schedules module. Select the schedule to use and its effective dates are used for the time range.</p>
        <h2>Controlled access</h2>
        <p>Access to a time frame can be controlled by keeping it private (for logged-in user only), public (any role or user), or shared only with selected users or roles.</p>
        <h2>Central maintenance and local availability</h2>
        <p>The Time Frame module provides a centralized maintenance window where time frames are created and edited for use in other modules. This maintenance area can be accessed when selecting a time frame. This makes it easy to work with time frames without having to switch away from the current work area.</p>
