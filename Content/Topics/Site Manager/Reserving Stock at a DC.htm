        <h1>Reserving stock at a distribution center</h1>
        <p>Stock can be reserved in a distribution center (DC) for use by specific stores and channels. For example, reserving stock for a new store ensures stock is available when it opens or reserving stock for a specific sales channel such as e-commerce. </p>
        <p>Reserved stock is logically partitioned to hide it from other sites or channels. This also prevents it from influencing normal order quantities for other sites and channels.</p>
        <p>The actual amount of stock reserved for a store or channel is demand-driven and can vary from store-to-store and item-to-item based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how many days of stock to reserve.</li>
            <li>whether to include safety stock in the reservation.</li>
            <li>the forecasted demand for the item at that location.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reservations-related fields</h2>
        <p>The following fields support stock reservations. For easy management and visibility of stock reservation settings, add them as columns in <a href="Creating a Site Manager Document.htm">Site Manager documents</a>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Reserve?</span>  – Whether stock should be reserved for a store or channel.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Days Reserved</span>  – The number of days of demand to cover when calculating how much stock to reserve.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Consider Presentation?</span> – Whether safety stock (Safety Stock Days and Minimum Safety Stock Units values) should be included when calculating how much stock to reserve.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Is Contained in Location Strategy?</span> – Read-only. Displays whether the site is part of a location strategy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Default values for these fields can be set by store in Site Manager. If a site is part of a location strategy, the default values can be overridden in the Allocation module's <a href="../Allocations/Location Exceptions View.htm">Location Exceptions</a> view.</p>
        <h2>Reserving stock for placeholder sites, stores, or channels</h2>
        <p>Stock for placeholder sites and regular stores or channels can be reserved. </p>
