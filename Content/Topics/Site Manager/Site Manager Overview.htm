        <h1>Site Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Use the Site Manager module to view and modify information about store sites.</p>
        <h2>Site Manager documents</h2>
        <p>Site data is managed in tabs called Site Manager documents. The collection of sites displayed in a Site Manager document is controlled by a filter which limits the sites to only those that need attention. Multiple documents can be open at a time and each document can list a separate set of sites. </p>
        <h2>Site modeling</h2>
        <p>When opening a new store or Distribution Center (DC), select an existing store or DC to model forecasts after. This creates a store supersession which uses the product level sales history from the model site to forecast demand for the new site. Orders for the new site can then be generated based on the modeled forecasts. </p>
        <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Planning Demand for a New Store.htm">Planning demand for a new store.</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2>Global priority</h2>
        <p>Global priority sets the default order in which sites should be sourced when any site experiences a shortfall in stock. </p>
