        <h1>Setting site capacity values</h1>
        <p>Site Capacity values are entered in the <span class="Emphasis">Site Capacity Temporal</span> blade within Site Manager by setting a hierarchy level and a time frame (in weeks). These values  display in the Allocation Rollup. Having Site Capacity values display in the Allocation Rollup provides more insights for reporting and filtering purposes.
</p>
        <p class="Important">When the Site Capacity Hierarchy is changed, the data must be cleared manually otherwise there is the potential to have values in the wrong place. To properly set Site Capacity values, ensure the Hierarchy that is defined by Site Capacity is aligned to the Hierarchy used for Rollup Aggregation.</p>
