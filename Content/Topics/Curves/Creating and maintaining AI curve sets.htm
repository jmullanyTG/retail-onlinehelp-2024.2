        <h1>Creating and using AI curve sets</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">AI Curve Sets</span> screen has two primary functions: the generation of Seasonal Curves from a customer’s database of sales histories and the assignment of these curves to levels.</p>
        <p>Curve Sets provide a more automated and intelligent way of selecting and assigning seasonal sales curves for specific SKU-locations. Existing data can be better utilized to assist with selection and assignment of seasonal curves using Curve Sets.</p>
        <p>Historical information can be leveraged  from across the database to isolate the most common annual sales behaviors, determine for each item which of these trajectories is most likely the best match, and employ said shapes in generating sales forecasts.</p>
        <p>Leveraging the whole database to make a forecast, rather than just an individual item’s history, can greatly enhance accuracy. Improvements should be expected for items with short life cycles, high intermittency, or where long range forecasts are desired.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The AI Curve Sets functionality is in addition to the standard curve functionality called Manual Curves. The AI Curve Sets functionality exists in parallel and either or both can be used. When forecasting, if an item has both a Manual Curve and an AI Curve, the Manual Curve takes precedence.</p>
        <h2>System policies</h2>
        <p>The following table describes the seasonal curve related system policies.</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../../Resources/TableStyles/standard.css');" class="TableStyle-standard" cellspacing="0">

                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyD-Column2-Body1">
                        Day of year to ignore. Because 365 % (52*7) = 1 (e.g. 52 standard weeks leaves one extra day a year), one day must be ignored. This should be a day that is not a holiday, part of a regular sales event (e.g. back to school), or otherwise particularly important. 
                        <p>When pulling sales histories into standard years to make or assign Seasonal Curves, this day is ignored. When translating a seasonal curve into a regular bucket or period, the value for this day is assumed to be the average of the weeks on either side. Defaults to 160. Must be between 1 and 365. </p><p>To preserve 7-sequential-day rule, this is rounded down to nearest mod 7 + 1 if its modulus with 7 is not already 1.</p></td>

        <h2>Accessing the AI Curve Sets screen</h2>
        <p>To access the <span class="Emphasis">AI Curve Sets</span> screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="Emphasis">Execute &gt; Curves</span> and select the <span class="Emphasis">AI Curve Sets</span> tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>AI Curve Sets</h2>
        <p>AI Curve Sets analyze historic sales data to generate Seasonal Curves, as defined by specified parameters. Curve Sets are generated based on the forecast leveling hierarchy specified in the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Level Forecast Hierarchy</span>.</p>
        <p>Once a set is generated, each level in the hierarchy is assigned to a curve in the set based on its sales history.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Assignment of levels not used in generation happens during a weekly task.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Curves/AI Curve Sets screen.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The core idea  is that  a small number of Seasonal Curves, generally 5-20, are generated. These curves represent the most common sales trends of products in the customer’s history. For example, products that sell well in the spring and summer but have zero sales in the winter, products with mostly flat sales except a significant Christmas spike, products that sell consistently all year long, and so on. Each level in the forecasting hierarchy is then assigned to one of these curves, and all inventories in that level use the curve as well. When forecasting, the new or revised methods assume the shape of future sales roughly follow the assigned curve.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Seasonal Curves can be used to provide likely shapes to new items which lack sales history, and more broadly in other parts of retail planning</p>
        <h2>Creating AI Curve Sets</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">New</span> on the AI Curve Set toolbar.</li>
            <li>Complete the fields as required in the <span class="Emphasis">AI Curve Set Maintenance</span> window.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> when finished.</p>
                <p>The AI Curve Set is created.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To build a candidate curve, click the <span class="Emphasis">Generate Candidate Curves</span> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span> in the confirmation dialog.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Once the curves are generated, navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Candidate Curves</span> tab in the lower box to see the curves. These are candidate curves, and can’t be used for forecasting. At this point, change the parameters of the set with the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button and regenerate the curves until a satisfactory set is achieved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once a satisfactory set is achieved, click the <span class="Emphasis">Promote Candidate Curves</span> button to make the set permanent.</p>
                <p>At this point, levels that were used in the generation of the curve set are assigned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Activate Curve Set</span> to make the Curve Set the forecasting set.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Only one Curve Set can be used to forecast.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Regenerating Curve Sets</h2>
        <p>Regenerating a Curve Set (or more precisely, promoting a new set of candidate curves in a set which already has a promoted set) will result in losing all existing curve assignments for that set. It is advised to instead build a new set when changes are desired (e.g. in a yearly re-build of the sets).</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>The hyperparameters (<span class="Emphasis">Number of Curves</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Min Sales Weeks For Inclusion</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Smoothing Window</span>) present a tradeoff between precision and accuracy. Increasing smoothing generally results in more accurate forecasts, but loses precision on things like Christmas spikes and short life cycle items. </p>
        <p>A higher Curve Count can result in better curves for customers with many variable but internally regular sales patterns, but is also likely to pick up on non-representative behavior. In general, the more levels used to generate each curve (i.e. higher customer database size to curve count ratio) and the more smoothing applied, the higher the accuracy. But of course, that also means curves will be aggregate averages and provide fewer specific insights.</p>
        <h3>Level forecast hierarchies with no sales</h3>
        <p>A default curve is assigned if a level has no sales. When a default curve is assigned, the next review date is shorter than the normal curve assignment.</p>
