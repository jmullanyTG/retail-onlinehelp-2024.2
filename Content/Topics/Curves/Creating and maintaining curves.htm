        <h1>Creating and maintaining curves</h1>
        <p>Curves are generated using data that has been imported into the system. The data can also be imported as-is using the standard import mechanism. </p>
        <p>Curves are a representation of the available data and not the interface though which the data is applied. </p>
        <p>Tags are used within the curves module as an attribute to help sort and categorize curves. They are distinctly different from the other forms of tags within the system. </p>
        <h2>Interacting with curve values</h2>
        <p>Interaction with curve values in the curve detail section is limited to two actions: manipulation of the effective series and the build series values. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Curve are graphically represented using an interactive line graph. Values can be manipulated by dragging bullet points up or down. The curve values are re-calculated simultaneously. Grid values change dynamically when manual adjustments are made to curves.</p>

        <p>Curves can be manually edited in the grid as well as in the graph. </p>

        <p>The curve can be named and security rights added at the time of creation. If desired, tags may be applied by clicking the <span class="Emphasis">Tag Links</span> button and adding tags using the <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Curve Tag Links</span> dialog. </p>

        <p>Remaining details are added in the second wizard screen. Filter values must be entered.</p>

        <p>Once built, click the <span class="Emphasis">Preview Curve</span> button to preview the curve.</p>
