        <h1>Price and Markdown Overview</h1>
        <p>Price planning lets users control the complete life cycle pricing of products from initial price to price adjustments and markdowns through to end of life. Prices can be created at any level of the product hierarchy with a complete view of current inventory, price elasticity and product rate of sale.</p>
        <p>The result is pricing that meets legal and corporate compliance while effectively managing product price life cycles so that margins and customer satisfaction are maximized. </p>
        <p>The solution includes a powerful rules engine that includes calculations and validations. This allows users to create and enforce rules for internal and external purposes. For example, competitor, rounding, vendor, legal compliance and financial rules. Multiple rules can be designed to guide users through a defined workflow and approval process.</p>
        <p>Users have immediate visibility into any potential problems before plans are submitted. This reduces the planning process timeline allowing for faster reaction to market conditions. Exceptions can be made visible in the Dashboard letting users focus on the elements that require attention.</p>
        <p>During the planning process, there is visibility to the entire price life cycle of  categories and products. One unified view displays regular, promotional, markdown and clearance prices. This helps users quickly and easily identify overlaps and decide on pricing cadence.</p>
