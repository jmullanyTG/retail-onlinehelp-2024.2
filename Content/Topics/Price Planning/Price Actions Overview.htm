        <h1>Price actions</h1>
        <p>
        Price actions can be configured with the same, or a subset of, products and sites from the pricing plan to apply a pricing strategy (i.e. validations and calculations with rounding rules) to generate a new retail sale price for a specific date, forward. While the start date, products and sites are limited by the configured pricing plan, they can be further excluded at the price action level. Any manual entry entered at the price action cluster or variant summary level is pushed down to the individual product/site level. Specific sites and individual products within a variant group can be edited. </p>
        <h2>Validation failures</h2>
        <p>The Price Actions grid has a column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Validation</span> column. The Validation Severity icons distinguish between validation failures that have been reviewed and validation failures that have not yet been reviewed or resolved by modifying the price action to comply with corporate pricing guardrails.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Validation Log and Overriding Validation Errors.htm">Price Action Validation Icons, the Validation Log, and Overriding Validation Errors</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>New store price actions with zero priced items</h2>
        <p>For new store price actions with zero priced items, the zero priced items are stripped out to separate price actions with the suffix <span class="Emphasis">ZP Page-#</span>. This makes it much easier to deal with zero priced items as they are all together in much smaller and manageable price actions. The number of variants in each price action is limited by the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Auto Generated Price Action Limit</span> (Module: Price Planning).</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Any VariantSites that have no price records are excluded.</p>
