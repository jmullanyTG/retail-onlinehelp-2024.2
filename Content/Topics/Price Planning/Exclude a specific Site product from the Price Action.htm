        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Items</span> grid (top) displays the individual products across all valid sites.  Modifying a value causes the system to shade the cell and to apply the modification to all sites. Site modifications can be viewed in the <span class="Emphasis">Item Locations</span>  grid (bottom).  </p>
        <p>Modifications may  affect calculated results which will be aggregated in the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> grid as well as marking the <span class="Emphasis">Exception</span> checkbox for ease of filtering.
