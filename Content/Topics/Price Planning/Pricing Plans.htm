        <h1>Pricing plans </h1>
        <p>A pricing plan is a container for a set of pricing actions. Plans specify the default start date, products, and sites that will be used by  the  associated pricing actions. Pricing plans can be viewed, added, edited, and deleted in the <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> screen. A dropdown field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Plan Selection</span> provides the option to select just a user's own plans or all plans.</p>
