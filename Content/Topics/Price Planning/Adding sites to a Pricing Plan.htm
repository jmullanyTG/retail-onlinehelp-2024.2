        </p>
        <p>To add an existing site to a pricing plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <span class="Emphasis">Add Site(s)</span> in the toolbar of the <span class="Emphasis">Sites</span> grid to open the <span class="Emphasis">Add a Site to an Existing Pricing Site Cluster</span> dialog.</li>
            <li>Click the dropdown arrow in the <span class="Emphasis">Site Filter</span> field to choose a set of sites and, if desired, check the <span class="Emphasis">Select only some items from the current filter</span> checkbox to refine the list to be returned.<ol><li><p>On the <span class="Emphasis">Site Selection</span> dialog, select the checkboxes for the sites to be added to the new site cluster.</p><p class="BasicNote"> Only those sites meeting the filter criteria and not already associated to the pricing plan’s pre-configured site clusters display.</p></li><li><p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>.</p><p>If the newly added site does not share the same currency the site cluster name is re-used by currency, e.g. EMEA(GBP) or EMEA(EUR).</p></li></ol></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">Add a Site to an Existing Pricing Site Cluster</span> dialog.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> on the confirmation pop-up window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the <span class="Emphasis">Activate the New Site(s) to Existing Action(s)</span> window displays, then select the price actions, not already exported, to include the new site.</p>
                <p> This   window does not display if there are no future price actions, or all future price actions are in a core status (a core status is not user configurable and does not display in Workflow). The following are core statuses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preparing Data for Export</li>
                    <li>Ready For Export</li>
                    <li>Exported</li>
                    <li>Export Confirmed</li>
                    <li>Exported With Errors</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If required, click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">Activate the New Site Cluster(s) to Existing Action(s)</span> window.</p>
                <p>Upon clicking <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>, the site is added to the site cluster. Associated sites are added to price actions as <span class="Emphasis">Included</span> and the Pricing Strategy Variable default values are applied to the new site and pushed down to Variants\Sites. Also, the following are marked as Calculation Required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Site Cluster Variant Sites</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Site Cluster Variants </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Price Action</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Price Action's Plan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a price action has gone into a calculating state, the site cluster and associated sites are added as <span class="Emphasis">Excluded</span> and a dialog displays indicating that not all price actions were updated.</p>
                <p>If a price action exists where the site cluster is <span class="Emphasis">Excluded</span>, then the new site is added as <span class="Emphasis">Excluded</span> to the excluded site cluster.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
