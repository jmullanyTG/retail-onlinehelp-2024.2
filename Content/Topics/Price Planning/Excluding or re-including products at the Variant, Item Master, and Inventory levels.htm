        <h1>Item Site plans: Advanced product exclusions</h1>
        <p>Products can be excluded at the Variant, Item Master, and Inventory levels using the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Product Exclusions</span> dialog. Multiple selections at a product parent level displays the summary of children at the lower levels for modification.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Exclusion</span> menu option in the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> grid is only available when the Pricing Plan has a Product Price Level of Item Site Plan. To confirm the Product Price Level, navigate to the Plan’s <span class="Emphasis">Information</span> tab.</p>
        <h2>Excluding a variant across all clusters at the price action level</h2>
        <p>A Variant can be excluded across all clusters at the Price Action level to avoid having to replicate modifications for each Cluster within the Price Action.</p>
        <p>To display the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Product Exclusions</span> dialog, click the <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Exclusions</span> button.</p>
