        <h1>Managing the products included in a pricing plan</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> grid is used to manage the products included in a pricing plan.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Variant grid.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The grid can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>add variants to a plan at any time</li>
            <li>remove variants from a plan at any time</li>
            <li>apply newly added variants to existing active price actions or new price actions</li>
            <li>automatically remove variants from existing active price actions when the variants are removed from the plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Adding variants to pricing plans</h2>
        <p>There are two ways to add additional products: using filter criteria or using the system clipboard. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Adding products from a filter</h3>
        <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Add &gt; from Filter</span> to choose an existing filter or click the <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Filters</span> icon to create a new filter. Once a filter is selected, click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> to append any new products to the existing product listing and then click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> to commit changes.</p>
        <p>If active pricing actions exist, a dialog displays to select which products to add to the price actions.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If products cannot be added, the pricing action may be in a status that does not allow modification with the user's assigned rights.</p>
        <h3>Adding products from the clipboard</h3>
        <p>Add products by selecting the right-click menu option <span class="Emphasis">Copy Column Cell(s)</span> in the Product grid in one plan and then selecting <span class="Emphasis">Add &gt; from Clipboard</span> in a second plan. </p>
        <p>All entries are validated and all failed products are logged for investigation. Successful entries are added to the pricing plan and the new products can be added to a price action. </p>
        <h2>Removing products from plans<br /></h2>
        <p>There are two methods to remove products: manual selection or using the clipboard.</p>
        <h3>Manual selection</h3>
        <p>To remove products from a plan, select and mark the checkbox adjacent to the appropriate products in the Pricing Plan Variant grid and click <span class="Emphasis">Remove Selected</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Products cannot be removed from a plan if they are being used in a price action.</p>
        <h3>Removing from clipboard</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> grid toolbar, select <span class="Emphasis">Remove &gt; from Clipboard</span>.</p>
        <p>The copied list should have one product (i.e. Variant or Item Master, global policy) per line.</p>
        <p>All entries are validated and all failed products are logged for investigation. For successful entries and upon confirmation, the products are removed and the price actions recalculated.</p>
