        <h1>Modify a price strategy rule</h1>
        <p>Modifications can be made directly to the Price Strategy Rule grid. Modifications cannot be made to the Rule Type and Rule Calculation fields. Modifying Price Strategy Rules causes associated Price Actions to be marked for recalculation and evaluation, unless already exported.</p>
        <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> to save any modifications. Click <span class="Emphasis">Cancel</span> to discard any modifications.  </p>
        <h2>Modifying the Priority Order</h2>
        <p>Enter the new priority order value for the Price Strategy Rule to be modified and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. The existing priorities are re-ordered accordingly.<br /></p>
        <p class="Example">Priority Order 1 – 7 and #5 is modified to #2.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>#1 will remain #1</li>
            <li>#2 becomes #3</li>
            <li>#3 becomes #4</li>
            <li>#4 becomes #5</li>
            <li>#6 stays #6</li>
            <li>#7 stays #7</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Modifying the Validation Severity</h2>
