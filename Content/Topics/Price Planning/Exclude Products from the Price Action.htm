        <h1>Variant Site plans: Excluding or re-including a variant or site</h1>
        <p>In the Pricing Plan’s <span class="Emphasis">Actions</span> tab, select a price action and click <span class="Emphasis">Open</span> to display the price action in a separate tab. The price action’s particulars display in the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> section.</p>
        <h2>Excluding a variant from all configured sites</h2>
        <p>To exclude a variant from all configured sites:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> grid, select a variant and click the <span class="Emphasis">Variant Details</span> button on the toolbar to display the <span class="Emphasis">Variant Details</span> view.</p>

                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Exclude Products from the Price Action.png" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Select the check box in the first column and click <span class="Emphasis">Exclude</span> on the toolbar.
			<p>The screen automatically refreshes and the names of excluded variants are denoted by a strikethrough. </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Important">The system will not implement any Price Strategy calculations nor validations for any products within the variant. </p>
        <h2>Re-including a variant in all configured sites</h2>
        <p>To re-include a variant to all configured sites:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> grid, select the variant and click the <span class="Emphasis">Variant Details</span> button on the toolbar to display the <span class="Emphasis">Variant Details</span> view</li>
            <li>Select the excluded variant (denoted by a strikethrough) and click <span class="Emphasis">Include</span>.
			<p>The screen automatically refreshes and the strikethrough is removed. </p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Excluding a site from a price action</h2>
        <p>To exclude a site:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Sites</span> tab in the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> section.</li>
            <li>Mark the checkbox adjacent to the site.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Exclude</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Exclude Sites from the Price Action.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the exclusion is confirmed, excluded sites are marked with a strikethrough. Excluding sites causes removal of pricing for all variants meaning that Price Strategy calculations are not implemented nor validations against products for the excluded sites. </p>
        <h2>Re-including a site in a price action</h2>
        <p>Excluded sites are denoted by a strikethrough.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To a re-include an excluded site, mark the checkbox adjacent to the site and click <span class="Emphasis">Include</span>.</li>
        </ul>
