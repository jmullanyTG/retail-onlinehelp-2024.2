        <h1>Configuring normal stocked settings</h1>
        <p>The Normal Stocked policy type indicates that the item is  a regular everyday selling item that must be continually stocked and replenished when its ordering criteria are met. Normal stocked items are replenished using a fixed-period ordering methodology. This classification is best suited to items where demand is not intermittent (having periods of no demand interspersed with periods of low demand) and forecasting for future demand is reasonably achievable. </p>
        <h2>To configure normal stocked settings</h2>
