        <h1>Negative normal and event causals</h1>
        <p>The behavior of a negative value in types <span class="Emphasis">Causal</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Event</span> is controlled through the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Ignore Negative Causals</span> (Engine: Forecasts), which defaults to <span class="Emphasis">No</span>. </p>
        <p>If set to <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span>, the causal application logic ignores negative causals as it refers to the slope of the causal factor in relation to the sales data series. Thus, negative causal factors are allowed to have negative effects (but not positive effects) when the option is set.</p>
