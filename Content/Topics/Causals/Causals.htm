        <h1>Causals and the Iterative Decomposition method</h1>
        <p>The effect that causals and events have on forecasts is determined by a process called iterative decomposition. This iterative process starts by calculating the coefficient of determination&#160;(model fit)&#160;of every causal or event data versus the historical sales figures (i.e. calculates a factor that indicates how well each causal or event corresponds with changing historical sales data). The causal or event that gives the best model fit is then identified and the effect it is expected to have had on the historical sales is subtracted (or added) to the sales data. </p>
        <p>After the causal or event effect is removed from the historic sales, the model fit for each of the remaining causals is then recalculated. The best one is removed. This process continues until such time as there are no more causals left, or the model fit of the causals left over is 0 (no effect). What is effectively left is a series of sales history data that would have resulted without the influence of any causals or events. These values are then taken into account during the forecast. After the forecasting is done, the effects of the causals are reapplied and re-forecast taking each causal into account. This is done in the reverse order as the process of removing causals, so the first causal effect that was removed, will be the last one placed back. </p>
        <p>The major advantage of this method is that the effect of one causal might be very well picked up, after another causal effect is removed. This is why it is successful in a retail environment as the month-end spikes are then removed before the yearly season's effect is determined.</p>
