      <h1>Engine Template Overview</h1>
      <p>
         <span class="Emphasis">Engine Template</span> is located under the <span class="Emphasis">Management</span> tab.</p>
      <p>There are two default task detail templates that can be used by the Engine to run items requested by the user without requiring any input from the user about the configuration. These templates are configured by editing a <span class="Emphasis">Replenish Task</span> form or a <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Task</span> form and saving the updated configuration into the template.</p>
      <p>The purpose of these templates is to allow processes that should not require user input to be able to create engine tasks with appropriate predefined settings. The immediate need for the engine templates are for engine chain tasks to be created with default predefined settings that require no task form popups for the user to configure.</p>
