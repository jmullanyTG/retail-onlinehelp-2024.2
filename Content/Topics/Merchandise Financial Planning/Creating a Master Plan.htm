        <h1>Creating a master plan</h1>
        <p>The first action when working in the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view is to create a master plan.&#160; A master plan is a Financial Plan that is considered to be the single version of the truth.&#160; Master plans should be used as approved plans within the planning process.&#160; Master plans contain historic and plan periods.&#160; Historic periods represent what actually happened within the business and plan periods are the approved plans for future periods.&#160; </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">In managing a Master plan it is recommended that a super user or system administrator has control over this feature.</p>
        <h2>To create a master plan:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="Emphasis">New</span> button on the toolbar.
				<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/New Master Plan.png" class="LargeImages" /></p><p>The <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Financial Plan</span> window displays with tabs available for creating a new plan.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Maintain Financial Plan screen - NEW.png" class="LargeImages" /></p><p>When the screen is completed, click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> to create the plan based on all the criteria that was defined in the  tabs contained in the <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Financial Plan</span> window that display when creating plans.&#160; New plans display automatically.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To edit a master plan:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button on the toolbar.</li>
            <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Financial Plan</span> window displays with tabs available for editing an existing plan.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Maintain Financial Plan screen - EDIT.png" class="LargeImages" />
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Initializing a plan</h2>
        <p>To initialize a plan, click the <span class="Emphasis">Initialize</span> icon in the header of the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view. The <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view displays and the plan is assigned the status of <span class="Emphasis">Initialized</span>.</p>
        <h2>Tab descriptions</h2>
        <h3>General tab</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">General</span> tab is used to configure the master plan's name and description, plan type, currency to work with, data values, calendar to plan with, the level of the calendar, and start period.&#160; These general settings form the basis of the structure of the master plan.&#160; </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Name</span>:&#160; The name of the plan</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Description</span>:&#160; What the plan is and any other important information about the plan that may be important to the user group.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Plan Type</span>:&#160;The metric set and calculations that will make up the master plan.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Cost-Based Plan</span>: This plan provides the ability to plan by Channel/location groups at defined levels of the product hierarchy.&#160; This plan contains the ability to plan sales, cost of sales, margin, inventory, receipts, and open to buy to support the budgeting process.&#160; This plan is for clients who value their inventory at cost.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Cost Dual-Markdown Plan (HCDM)</span>: This plan type allows organizations to plan their permanent and promotional markdowns separately. Promotional markdowns are tied directly to Promotional Sales and reduce AUR for periods in which they are realized, impacting margin through that reduction. Conversely, because markdown sales do not necessarily occur in the same period in which the actual markdowns are taken, Permanent Markdowns are managed strictly as a percentage of sales, and are subtracted directly from the Maintained Margin value for the period in which they occur. </p>
                <p>In this plan type, average unit cost (AUC) and average unit ticket (AUT) do not typically change from period to period because of changes to the sales plan. AUC changes as a result of incoming receipts or other changes to the inventory mix. AUT only changes if the user changes it directly or indirectly, through a change in IMU %.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Retail Dual-Markdown Plan (HRDM)</span>: Behaves in the same way as the Hybrid Cost Dual-Markdown plan type. This new plan type applies a Cumulative Markup (CMU) percentage to retail values to determine margin, cost of goods sold, and ending inventory for cost. This allows planning teams to focus on retail values and AUR while the CMU drives the efficiency and accuracy of financial plans.</p>
                <p>As the name implies, there are two markdown metrics in the HRDM plan. The Markdowns (Perm) and Markdowns (Promo) fields are enabled for the Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown plan type, as well as the Markdowns (Total) field. All are plannable.</p>
                <h4>Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown plan-specific metrics</h4>
                <p>There are Current plan year, Comparison, and LY versions of all of the below metrics. The only user-editable metric described below is the <span class="Emphasis">Season Begin</span> metric.</p>

        <p>Further, actualized values can be imported via the API import process.  If a historical period is provided, it must either be: a) for a master plan, or b) for an Original Plan (OP) branch plan type.  Historical data is not valid for Default typed branches. Such data is discarded with a warning in import logs.  

</p>
        <p>Note that some consideration must be paid between timing API imports and MFP maintenance. If the API import runs and imports actualized data for the last 4 weeks, but then the default MFP maintenance runs for the last 8 weeks, then all of the values imported in the first step is zeroed out and replaced with whatever values are found in the other standard data feeds (sales history, inventory history, etc).  Some care needs to be taken to set up and sequence imports and maintenance so that the desired plans, metrics, and periods have data maintained by the desired feed.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">When import posts run for plans of type Import, hierarchy levels are automatically added to the plan based on the import data. If desired, the API can be run in Window mode, deleting all existing data in a plan and re-loading it from the import data.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Seed Type</span>:&#160; Defines how future periods in the plan are seeded for the metrics offered within the plan type that has been selected.&#160;There are three standard seeding options to choose from.&#160;Seed Types cannot be combined to seed future periods when creating the plan.</p>

            <li><span class="Emphasis">Forecasted Sales</span>: Seeds future periods with sales units that are coming from the forecast module.&#160; Sales are derived by multiplying the forecasted sales units times the average unit retail from last year’s comparable periods.</li>

        <p><span class="Emphasis">Calendar Level</span>:&#160; The lowest level of time used in the master plan.&#160; There are three standard options: Year, Month, and Week. Most plans created in this module go to the Month or Week level.</p>

        <h3>View Collection tab</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">View Collection</span> tab defines the collection of metrics that are contained within the plan as well as the collection of metrics that are contained within any snapshot taken of the plan.&#160; </p>

Changes to this section must only be made if different view collection sets are required.</p>
