      <h1>Technical note on customizations</h1>
      <p>To our technical consultants, we recognize that specific business needs vary greatly from client to client, giving rise to the need for customizations. </p>
      <p>MFP can  be customized with additional metrics to help meet client needs. However, to maintain the stability of the carefully balanced calculation model, the standard set of calculations should not be altered. There are many metric inter-dependencies which may not be immediately apparent and changing the interactions of these metrics is likely to yield unpredictable results. </p>
      <p>That said, the addition of non-editable informational metrics that calculate based on the existing set is possible without repercussion. If a client requires changes to the system that will alter standard calculations in any way, it is highly recommended that these be submitted as enhancement requests, so the product and development teams can ensure no unforeseen issues will arise.  </p>
