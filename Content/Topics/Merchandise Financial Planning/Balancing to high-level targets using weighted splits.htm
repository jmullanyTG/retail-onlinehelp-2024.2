        <h1>Balancing to high-level targets using weighted splits</h1>
        <p>One approach to planning within MFP is working to get all lowest level values properly tiered and then entering high-level targets at the end. Effectively, this rebalances the entire plan while maintaining the overall structure of the work already done.</p>
        <h3>Example of balancing</h3>
        <p>When period level or aggregate level values beneath must be kept intact, users can use this method in tandem with Lock &amp; Spread functionality to change only unlocked cells to achieve a $120,000 target. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Lock Spread.htm">Lock &amp; Spread</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>For sales across the US and the UK, across multiple channels and brands, the original sales target is $94,322 across the board for 2017_m07.</p>

        <p>The sales target is revised to $120,000.</p>

        </p>
        <p>By entering the desired target value of $120,000 in the <span class="Emphasis">Grand Total</span> row for 2017_m07, the sales ratios are maintained at every level from Country to Brand.</p>
