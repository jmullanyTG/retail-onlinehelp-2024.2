        <h1>Customizing the financial planning screen</h1>
        <p>The Financial Planning module makes it easy to design work spaces and layouts that drive versatility and take the pain out of switching between different areas of a financial plan. </p>
        <p>The three ways to customize the Financial Planning screen are:</p>
        <h2>Work spaces</h2>
        <p>Work spaces represent the arrangement of tabs and panes on and off the screen. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/workspace example.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>To save or retrieve a changed work space, right-click above the grid and select an option.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Save Changed Workspace.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Layouts</h2>
        <p>A layout is the combination of the row and column groupings that create the pivot grid (typically product, channel, and time period) plus any filters on row and column headers plus the data fields (metrics) whose values appear inside the Hybrid Financial Planning Grid.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/layout example.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Data layouts</h2>
        <p>A data layout is the set of data fields contained in a given layout. Restoring a data layout changes the metrics displayed in the grid while leaving  current pivots (row and column groupings) and filters intact. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/data layout example.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Data layouts cannot be saved  by themselves. Instead, the entire layout is saved. It then appears as an option in the Restore Data Layout menu.</p>
        <p>Work spaces, layouts, and data layouts can be mixed and matched. For example, the following can be created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> a workspace that maximizes the Hybrid Financial Grid by hiding the Calculation Direction Toggles and Locks On Selected Data panes.</li>
            <li>a layout that contains the pivots  (channel, product, and time periods) and filters for the areas of the plan the user is responsible for, along with the basic set of metrics to work on.</li>
            <li>additional layouts containing different data sets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To see a different set of metrics while preserving the current workspace, pivots, and filters, restore the data layout that contains those metrics. Only the data fields displayed in the grid change as workspace, pivots, and filters persist until users change them. </p>
