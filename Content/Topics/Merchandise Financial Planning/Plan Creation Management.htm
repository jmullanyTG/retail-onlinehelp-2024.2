        <h1>Creating and managing financial plans</h1>
        <p>Financial planning involves multiple types of plans:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Master plan</span> - A master plan is the single version of truth and can only be edited through an approval and/or merge process.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Branch plan</span> - A branch plan is a copy of either a master plan or another branch plan. It is a working copy where changes to a plan can be made. These changes can then be uploaded to the master plan through an approval and/or merge process.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Snapshot</span> - Snapshots are locked-down versions of a plan that cannot be edited and do not actualize. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Create and manage these plans using the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> window. </p>
