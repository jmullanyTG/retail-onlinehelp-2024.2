        <h1>Creating snapshots</h1>
        <p>Snapshots serve as the third main concept of plans and are managed in the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view.&#160;Snapshots are locked down versions of Master or Branch plans. The main differences between a snapshot and any other plan is they do not actualize as time moves forward.&#160;Snapshots can be accessed on the right hand side of view and are specific to the master or branch plan highlighted on the left hand side of the view.&#160; </p>
        <h2>Accessing snapshot functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the <span class="Emphasis">Snapshots</span> tab on the right side of the view.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>The Snapshots tab</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Snapshots</span> tab is used to set up plan snapshots which occur on a regular schedule as well as to create and delete snapshots manually.&#160;Snapshots are captures of the state of the current plan at the time they are generated for the purpose of future comparisons as users work with the plan. </p>
        <p>There are two main components that make up the <span class="Emphasis">Snapshots</span> tab.&#160; The top portion of the view is the <span class="Emphasis">MFP Snapshot Templates</span>.</p>

                <p>FXN updates future periods with the current run date’s conversion rates, which may vary over time. Past periods will use that period’s conversion rate, which will likely not change as the period is actualized. For example,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Future period 2024_wk52 uses today’s currency conversion rate for FXN values</li>
                    <li>Past period 2021_wk01 uses 2021_wk01’s currency conversion rate for FXN values</li>
                </ul>
