        <h1>Designing and saving layouts</h1>
        <p>A layout is the combination of pivots, filters, and data fields (metrics) that appear in the <span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Financial Planning Grid</span> view. Layouts can be customized by adding or removing fields, applying filters, and aggregating or disaggregating metrics. Custom layouts can be saved for later use.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Adding, Removing, and Rearranging Fields.htm">Adding, removing, and rearranging fields</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Using data layouts to work with subsets of metrics</h2>
        <p>With the wide array of metrics available in Merchandise Financial Planning, having the full set visible while working on a plan can be overwhelming. Users can select a desired subset of metrics and save them as a particular data layout. Restoring a data layout changes the fields used as metrics in the data area of the planning grid without changing the current filters and pivot fields.</p>
        <p>For example, the following layout focuses the metric selection solely on unit flow from period to period. This ensures the receipt strategy adequately accounts for sales and other inventory movements in each period without having to worry about the revenue component until ready.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the unit receipt strategy is ready, users can switch the data layout and work on the receipt cost, retail and IMU %. The metric selection can be modified to include Sales, BOP Retail, and EOP Retail to ensure the receipt revenue strategy yields a positive result through each period.</p>
