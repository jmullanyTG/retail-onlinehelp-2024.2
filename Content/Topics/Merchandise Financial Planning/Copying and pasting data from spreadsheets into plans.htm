        <h1>Copying and pasting data into and within financial plans</h1>
        <p>Data can be copied and pasted either directly into a financial plan from spreadsheets and from one section to another section within a financial plan. While the copy and paste process is essentially the same as standard copying and pasting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>data cannot be pasted onto a non-editable cell (non-editable cells are skipped)</li>
            <li>the focused cell or top-left cell of the selection on the pivot grid (in the case of a multi-select) must be editable. If the focused cell is not editable, then the Paste option is not shown.</li>
            <li>if pasting onto a normal cell and then a total cell (e.g. paste into Week 2021_wk34 and 2021_m08 total at the same time) then the lower level value is overwritten by the total cell.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Copying and pasting data</h2>
        <p>To copy and paste data from a spreadsheet into a plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select and copy the desired cells in the spreadsheet.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Optionally, if a header row is copied, right-click and select <span class="Emphasis">Paste Options &gt; Remove Headers</span>.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Remove Headers removes the first row of values that have been copied as they are considered to be headers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Within a target cell in a plan, right-click and select <span class="Emphasis">Paste From Clipboard</span> from the dropdown menu.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To copy rows or sections of data from one part of a pivot to another:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Highlight the desired values.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Copy Section of Pivot Grid.png" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Press CTRL+ C.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Highlight the desired location to paste.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that <span class="Emphasis">Remove Headers</span> is not checked otherwise a row is lost.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Either press CTRL +&#160;V or Ctrl-V or right-click and select <span class="Emphasis">Paste from Clipboard</span>.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">The values are pasted using each selected cell as a starting point.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
