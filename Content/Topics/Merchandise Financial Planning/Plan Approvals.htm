        <h1>Plan approvals</h1>
        <p>A process can be set up to review, approve, reject, and merge branch plans. A plan’s status  changes to <span class="Emphasis">In-Progress</span> once it has been adjusted. The plan can then be sent to an authorized user for approval.&#160;</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This process can support pre-season as well as in-season reviews.</p>
        <p>The functionality available for the plan approval process is contained within the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view.&#160;</p>
        <h2>Best practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Before approving plans, it is a good idea to create an additional branch of the plan that takes on the merged changes.  Once a plan has been merged to another, it’s difficult to revert back to the plans that existed prior to the merge or approval process.  This makes it easier to revert back to the plans that existed prior to any approval or merge.</li>
            <li>Create a plan review calendar to establish deadlines for Pre-season and In-season plan reviews.  Users can take full advantage of the plan approval functionality if they know their due dates.</li>
            <li>Limit the number of branches that need approved during the plan approval process.  Creating branches that contain multiple product and location dimensions cuts down on the number of plans to be reviewed and approved.  This helps to streamline the process, especially for In-season plan reviews.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of the notes section during the approval or rejection process.  This allows users to focus on the area of the plan that needs reviewed or adjusted.</li>
            <li>Remind users that the notification inbox contains all the changes made in the Plan approval process.  This is where they see the progress being made during plan reviews.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sending a plan for approval</h2>
        <p>To send a plan to an authorized user for approval:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select the Branch plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Send Plan for Approval.png" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Submit</span> button on the toolbar.</p>
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Submit Financial Plan</span> window displays.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Submit Financial Plan.png" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete the fields as required.</p>
                <div class="Note_Important">Select the destination plan for which the source plan is to be approved and merged to.&#160; Add notes to help the approver through the approval process.&#160; </div>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The approval process</h2>
        <p>The plan is sent to the authorized approver for approval.&#160; The submitted branch plan then moves to a status of <span class="Emphasis">Awaiting Approval</span>.&#160; Approved plans are merged into the destination plan.&#160; </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Plan Status Awaiting Approval.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The destination plan changes to a status of <span class="Emphasis">Approved</span> and the merge history on the right hand side of the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view updates.&#160; </p>
        <h2>Merge History tab</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Merge History</span> tab is an audit trail of the approval process and displays when merges were made to and from the plans that are being worked with.</p>
        <p>The branch plan or source plan remains in <span class="Emphasis">Approved</span> status until changes are made at which time the status reverts back to <span class="Emphasis">In-Progress</span>.&#160; </p>
        <h2>Rejecting a plan</h2>
        <p>If the plan is rejected and not approved, then the plan is returned with any notes added by the authorized approver.&#160; </p>
        <p>To reject a plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="Emphasis">Reject</span> button to display the <span class="Emphasis">Reject Financial Plan</span> window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add any notes and send back to the planner to make the requested changes to the plan.</p>
                <p>The plan changes to a status of <span class="Emphasis">In-Progress</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
