        <h2>Period to-date/to-goal aggregation</h2>
        <p>The following  metrics are available in the main planning view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Month TD/TG </li>
            <li>Quarter TD/TG</li>
            <li>Year TD/TG </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these metrics has two components: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the to-date (TD) piece is an aggregation of the actualized portion of the period such as Month To Date Sales</li>
            <li>the to-go (TG) piece aggregates the remaining planned (but not actualized) portion of the period. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, assume a planned monthly sales goal of $100,000. If after 3 weeks there have been $65,000 in actualized sales, the Month TD value would be $65,000 and the Month TG value would be $35,000.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">TD/TG metrics for non-standard periods (Half, Season, etc.) require additional configuration.</p>
