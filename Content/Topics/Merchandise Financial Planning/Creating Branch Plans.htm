        <h1>Creating branch plans</h1>
        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view, Branch plans can be created once the Master Plan has been initialized.&#160;Branch plans are financial plans that are created from a Master plan and are directly editable.&#160; The Branch plan is used to make changes to a financial plan.&#160;  There is no limit to the number of Branches that can be created.&#160;</p>
        <h2>Branch plan association with Master plans</h2>
        <p>Branch plans are always associated with a Master plan.&#160; Once a Branch plan has been created it displays underneath the Master plan it is associated with in the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view. </p>
        <h2>To create a branch plan:</h2>
        <p>The steps to create a Branch plan are the same as for creating a Master plan. However, the criteria in each of the tabs is pre-populated with the selection criteria of the Master plan.&#160; </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Highlight the Master plan that the Branch will be created from. </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the <span class="Emphasis">Branch</span> button.</p>

                <p>Complete the fields in each tab as required.</p>
                <p>The two most important tabs are the <span class="Emphasis">Product</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Channel</span> tabs.&#160; These tabs contain the same selections as the Master plan. However, selections can be narrowed down.</p>
