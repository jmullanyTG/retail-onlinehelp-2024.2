        <h1>Setting up a Master Plan</h1>
        <p>The master plan is a financial plan that is created in the MFP module and is not editable. This plan is considered the single version of the truth and will be used as approved plans within the planning process.  Depending on the Plan Type (Hybrid-Cost, -Retail, -Cost-Dual-Markdown) required by the functional requirements, different tables are populated and maintained.  </p>
        <p>To create and initialize a Master Plan, see <MadCap:xref href="Creating a Master Plan.htm">Creating a master plan</MadCap:xref>.</p>
