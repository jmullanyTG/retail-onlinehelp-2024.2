        <h1>Merchandise Financial Planning Overview</h1>
        <p>The Financial Planning module combines essential planning functionality, such as Cost and Retail methods of accounting, calendar and period level configurability, and plan approval work flow with data management and user interaction. Once an accounting method is selected, a custom metric set and views can be defined from the set of metrics available to both methods. </p>
        <p>The calculation direction for metrics can be altered where multiple directions are desired (such as an option to calculate sales units or AUR when changing sales) without refreshing the screen for the change to take effect. Flexible metric locking capabilities allow holding specific period level values while spreading changes around them and locking aggregate level values, constraining changes made at lower levels to the locked totals.</p>
        <p>Lastly, a pivot grid is available that behaves like a Microsoft Excel Pivot Table. The grid allows for editing of plannable metrics at any level of the product, site, and time hierarchies and aggregating and disaggregating data via drag-and-drop actions.</p>
