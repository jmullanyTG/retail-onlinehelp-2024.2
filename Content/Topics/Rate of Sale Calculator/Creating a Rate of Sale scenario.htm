        <h1>Creating a Rate of Sale (ROS)&#160;scenario</h1>
        <p>A Rate of Sale scenario defines the inputs required to model historic data in which to generate rates of sale outputs.&#160; Users can define and save rate of sale scenarios for application now or in the future based on existing placeholder/variant and site filters or define filters dynamically to suit needs and specified time frames. </p>
        <p>Users can also apply Min/Max Price and Max Price Discount filters to limit the data being considered during calculation. </p>
        <p>Additionally, users can easily recall saved scenarios by filtering the list with placeholder/variant and site filters.&#160; Time frame selection can be static or dynamic with the ability to name dynamic ranges (i.e. Last 4 weeks). Dynamic scenarios recalculate regularly to make use of the most current historical data.&#160; </p>
        <p>Further filtering against the historical data is available to refine the ROS scenarios by defining minimum price, maximum price, maximum discounts and price types as restrictions on what is and is not included in the data set.</p>
