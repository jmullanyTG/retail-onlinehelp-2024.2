        <h1>Understanding the Rate of Sale Calculator</h1>
        <p>The Rate of Sale Calculator allows for quick and easy modeling of scenarios, both simple and complex. Use these scenarios to develop realistic estimations of the performance of an item in a given cluster during a specific time frame. This information can also be shared with other areas of the organization, such as buyers, merchants, sourcing teams etc. dynamically to establish confidence in these estimates as they relate to planning and executing within a merchandising organization.</p>
        <p>As with any tool, there is a learning curve to understanding the calculator and how to use it to its fullest. Here are a few tips to help maximize its usefulness as a regular part of the assortment planning process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Modeling after a single variant</span> – One of the most common of all situations is the need to estimate demand for a new item based on a similar item’s history. While the easiest way is via the <span class="Emphasis">Map From</span> option in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholders</span> dialog in Assortment Planning, using the ROS Calculator yields more accurate results, because of the added data cleansing. </p>
                <p>To achieve this, create a product filter with the single item to model after, or select a filter containing the desired item and exclude all other items using the Scenario Detail view, and calculate and apply the scenario as described. The cleansed and uncleaned rates of sale can be seen to understand potential differences in using both methods for similar situations in the future.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information regarding the <span class="Emphasis">Map From</span> option, see <MadCap:xref href="../Assortment Planning/Collection and placeholder overview.htm">Collection and placeholder overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Modeling after multiple variants</span> – There may be situations where new items need to be added to a product level or business segment quickly after a Target Creation scenario has already been used to Smart Start an assortment plan. There may not even be specific product images from which to gauge potential performance and only a vague idea of what the expected return will be on each. By creating a scenario using a product filter for the entire product level or group the new items will live within, an array of options is presented, based on top performers, bottom performers, and multiple bands in between, from which to choose. Use the Scenario Detail view to see which variants ranked into each performance band and make exclusions to fine-tune the results by band.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Modeling promotional variants</span> – Some organizations add a number of promotion only items during peak business seasons, such as for the Christmas holiday. A  variety of options are available to accurately model the potential demand for such items. If similar promotions were run  and the relevant items are attributed for easy identification, creating a scenario based on a product filter for items of the proper attribute is sufficient. More likely, the items are  part of a larger product level or group. </p>
                <p>Use a product filter for the relevant variants, select the Promo sales type, excluding all others, and set the time frame to the period the promotion ran. For even more details, if there is a defined Price Type for promotional pricing, use this in conjunction with the Min Price, Max Price, and/or Max Price Discount parameters to narrow the data pool to only variants whose promotional pricing fell within a certain price range or percent discount. These same methods can be applied when modeling rates of sale for markdown items.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Applying rates of sale to collections</span> – Adding an entire new collection (most commonly, a single style in multiple colors) to an assortment plan means not having to model each placeholder within the collection separately to achieve a good rate of sale estimate for each. Particularly in cases where the specific variants that will be assigned to the placeholders in a collection are not yet known, applying a rate of sale to the entire collection is recommended. </p>
                <p>Applying by collection uses the rate of sale selected for each cluster, and then it uses a multiplier derived from the marginal return curve created during scenario calculation to determine the diminishing rate of return for each successive placeholder within the collection. Not all colors of a given style perform exactly the same, and since the rate of sale tiering that occurs in collection-level applications of rates of sale is based on actual historical performance of variants within their respective collections, this method is likely to yield a more accurate result without users having to guess at the specifics.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote"> There are a few differences in the selections for Allocations type scenarios versus the Assortment Planning type scenarios referenced above. For more information related to application of the Rate of Sale Calculator within Allocations,  see the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation User</span> guide. </p>
