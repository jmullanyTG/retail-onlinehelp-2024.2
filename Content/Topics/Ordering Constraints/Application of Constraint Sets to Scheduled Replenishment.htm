        <h1>Application of constraint sets to scheduled replenishment tasks</h1>
        <p>Constraint sets require an order header as an application parameter as they’re designed to be a consciously applied user driven action within the replenishment/allocation process. This does not preclude constraint sets from being applied to task driven (that is overnight) runs. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To execute a constraint set, order headers must be created as part of a post-engine process, then the constraint sets may be run through execution of OrderManager.Order_Line_Inventory_Constrain  with the appropriate parameters. </p>
