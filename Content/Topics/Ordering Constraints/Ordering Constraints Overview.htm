        <h1>Ordering Constraints Overview</h1>
        <p>Ordering constraints are useful practical tools which are incorporated into the Replenishment workflow. Ordering constraints created within this module can be applied to orders within Order Manager. </p>

        <p>Constraint sets are organized by their name and description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Constraint Set Name</span> – Lists the user supplied name of the constraint set. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Description</span> – A description of the constraint set. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Constraint sets</h2>
        <p>Constraint sets allow for certain tolerances and rounding rules to be applied to constraints. Constraint sets are managed in a single screen with creation and maintenance performed using a common wizard. The constraint sets use mathematical rules to help drive the Replenishment process. </p>
        <h2>Cost types</h2>
        <p>Ordering constraints are an important consideration for the replenishment engine and are used to build supplier orders. </p>
