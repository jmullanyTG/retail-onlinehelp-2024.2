        <h1>Constraint groups</h1>
        <p>Constraint groups are used to selectively apply constraints to inventories in a given filter.  In this view, fields are available, such as Type Code (order policy indicator), Priority and Criticality (from Inventory Classifications), Product Groups 1-20 (inventory groups), and site groups 1-2.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Constraint groups are determined by the contents of the standard view uvw_ConstraintGroupName.</p>
