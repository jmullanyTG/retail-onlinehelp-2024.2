        <h1>Order line priority and locking</h1>
        <p>Select <span class="Emphasis">Locked for Constraints</span> to prevent the constraint logic from over-aggressively constraining a single order line to meet the goals of a constraint set. During the constraint process, order lines are prioritized.</p>
        <h2>Constraining up</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The order line is not locked</li>
            <li>The replenish order quantity (user order quantity) is a positive number</li>
            <li>The order line was not constrained within the previous loop or iteration </li>
            <li>Ordered by replenish order quantity, descending</li>
            <li>If replenish order quantity is identical, ordered by default priority, ascending</li>
            <li>If default priority is identical, ordered by OrderLineID</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This allows for the constraining up of items with a higher volume of future orders, whereas the current period order is relatively small. </p>
        <h2>Constraining down</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The order line is not locked</li>
            <li>The replenish order quantity (user order quantity) is a positive number</li>
            <li>The order line was not constrained within the previous loop/iteration </li>
            <li>Ordered by replenish order quantity, ascending</li>
            <li>If replenish order quantity is identical, ordered by default priority, descending</li>
            <li>If default priority is identical, ordered by OrderLineID</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This allows for the constraining up of items with a higher volume stock contained in the current period order, whereas the future period order is relatively small.</p>
