        <h1>Generating reports that include attribute values</h1>
        <p>Certain reports are designed to allow attribute values to be included to provide for the rollup of data sliced by the attribute values. One such report is the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Choice Count Report</span> (<span class="Emphasis">Plan &gt; Assortment Planning &gt; Dashboard &gt; Assortment Choice Count Report</span>).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Report Using Attributes.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>In the filter section of the report, select an attribute family to slice the data by. Also, select the specific attribute values that are relevant to the report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Data Sliced by Attribute Values.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The returned report shows the data sliced by the attribute values in question (for example, color). The counts of variants is sliced across regular, promotional and markdown counts although only regular counts are shown above.</p>
        <h2>Using attributes with filters</h2>
        <p>After linking attribute families and values to entities such as variants or item masters, filter the entities using the attribute families in question. </p>
        <h2>Creating filters or editing filters</h2>
        <p>Create new filters or edit existing filters in the <span class="Emphasis">Filters</span> module (<span class="Emphasis">Management &gt; Filters</span>) . </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/New or Edit Filters.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>An entity type must be selected to ensure that the appropriate attribute families can be returned and used in the filter.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Entity Type Selected.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>All available attribute families associated with the selected entity will be available and multiple attribute families can be selected to further refine the attribute in line with filter creation criteria.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Select Values.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Users can now select single or multiple values related to the attribute family selected.</p>
