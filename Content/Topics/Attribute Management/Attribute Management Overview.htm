        <h1>Attribute Management Overview</h1>
        <p>Attribute management has traditionally been restricted to defining core attributes in host systems and pushing these to the planning solution for use in reporting and other grouping functions. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Attribute Management/Attribute Management Module.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Management</span> solution can be used to </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>define attributes throughout the system all the way down to a product/location level.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> maintain new attribute families and storage of imported attribute families.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>define groups of attributes using attribute sets  which can be assigned to certain hierarchies of product.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Assignment of attribute values is a simple task that can be accomplished throughout the system. </p>
        <p>The view contains two tabs, <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Management</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Sets</span>, that are interconnected through the assignment of attribute families to attribute sets. </p>
