        <h1>The Attributes supporting view in Assortment Planning</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> supporting view in the Assortment Planning Placeholder and Collection views is used to view and manage product attributes for placeholders and collections. The <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view slides in from the right  side of the screen by default. </p>
        <p>

        <p>The attribute families available to select display based on the set they were assigned to and  how the attribute set was assigned to a level of the product hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Two selection options per parameter family is not allowed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Single Values</span> –  Select from this column if the parameter family was specified to only allow single values. The <span class="Emphasis">Multiple values</span> column is not editable. Click on the dropdown list and select the attribute value to assign to the placeholder variant or placeholder collection that is currently selected.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Multiple values</span> – Select and click on the ellipsis if the parameter family was specified to allow multiple values. A pop-up displays  for users to select multiple attributes to assign to the placeholder variant or placeholder collection that is currently selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Multiple lines can be selected to assign attributes. Users are not required to assign attributes one line at a time in either the Placeholder view or the Collection view.</p>
        <p>Note that attributes can be associated with placeholder variants and variants. Attributes can also be maintained on variants in the Variant Manager module. </p>
        <p>Users can segment the assortment across attributes to ensure the correct mix of assortment.</p>
        <p>In addition to slicing up assortments that have been built, attributes are an effective way to rationalize future assortments. The target creation process allows for attributes to be used in the estimation of the width and depth of future assortments needed to meet financial targets. </p>
        <p>For instance, use the price point range attribute to segment future assortments using the marginal return curve to estimate the number of options to offer in each price point range.</p>
