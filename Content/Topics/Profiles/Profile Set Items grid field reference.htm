        <h1>Profile Set Items screen fields and descriptions </h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Profile Set Items</span> screen details inventory specific information about how the profile is applied. This provides an overview of the inventories which are affected by the profile and in which way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Apply Override (%)</span> – Checked if it is intended to apply the override percentage. </li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Causal Shift</span> – Controls whether the total sales value of the model is held or increased based on the application of the causal.<ul><li><p><span class="Emphasis">Reshape</span> - Holds total sales and decreases the non-causaled period contributions (assuming a positive causal effect). It "reshapes" the whole profile to accommodate the causal factor.</p></li><li><p><span class="Emphasis">Lift</span> - Does not hold total sales and the impact of the causal is only recognized on the causaled period. It "lifts" the affected periods.</p></li></ul></li>
