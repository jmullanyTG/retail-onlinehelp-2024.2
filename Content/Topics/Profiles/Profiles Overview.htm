        <h1>Profiles Overview</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Profiles</span> module is used to simulate effective sales history for new items. This is done where sales history or a supersession are not used. Curves are created based on sets of familiar items with well established product life cycles. These curves are then applied to new items. </p>
        <p>Profiles are managed in a hierarchical manner with profile sets acting as the container for individual profiles. </p>
        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Profiles</span> module there are two main workflow screens: the <span class="Emphasis">Profile Management</span> screen and the <span class="Emphasis">Curve Management</span> screen. The <span class="Emphasis">Curve Management</span> screen is identical to the full <span class="Emphasis">Curves</span> module. </p>
