        <h1>Customer Manager </h1>
        <p>The Customer entity is managed within Customer Manager. </p>
        <p>Sites can be set up as site type <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> that represents a collection of customer accounts in a many customers to one <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site relationship. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 like other entities that can be used to show a hierarchy.  Users maintain the Customer entity and do the linking to the Account site entity in Customer Manager.</p>
        <p>Accounts are not directly replenished. All forecasted account demand is replenished at DCs where the stock is held until anticipated wholesale account purchases. The DC responsible for holding stock is defined in the <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> widget in Site Manager.</p>
        <p>Two new fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The usual rights (seen in variant manager, variant customer manager, etc) need to be associated to the module so that it displays.</p>
