        <h1>Forecasting selected slices of models</h1>
        <p>In the Group Forecasting solution, a selected slice of the model can be forecast. Slices are a vertical hierarchy built as a part of the model and are anchored around each item at the top of a static hierarchy. Slices can be forecasted individually to improve the overall performance of the Group Forecasting solution.</p>
        <p>The Forecast button, under Hierarchy Navigation on the Group Forecast screen, forecasts the entire slice associated with the highlighted node.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Lock</span> button locks only the highlighted node.</p>

        <p>When defining a node, that  node must begin at the highest level in the model. A node is the combination of two identification values: the SliceID and SliceLevelID (both based on quint keys).</p>
