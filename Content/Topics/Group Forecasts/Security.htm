        <h1>Security </h1>
        <p>When building group forecast models, it is possible to circumvent the item and assign filter restrictions. This is intentional, as access to these item/location combinations may be necessary to  build an accurate model. As such, assigning security rights to the model is an important step.</p>
        <p>The item assign filter rules are applied to the user who is creating the model (e.g. a user cannot create a model out of another user's item assign filter). However, users can view items outside of their item assign filter if the model is shared. Users working in the model “impersonate” the rights of the user who has created the model. </p>
        <p>Where interdepartmental security is important, users creating the model should specifically exclude users or roles which should not have view permission by changing the security setting to Private or Shared.</p>
