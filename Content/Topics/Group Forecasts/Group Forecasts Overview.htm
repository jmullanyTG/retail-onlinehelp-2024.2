        <h1>Group Forecasts Overview</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Group Forecasts</span> module is used to  build forecast models at hierarchical levels that can be drilled down to lower levels for use  as projected demand. </p>
        <h2>Forecast group model management</h2>
        <p>Group forecasts are generated by building a model, which is then processed by the forecasting engine to provide a statistical forecast or projected demand at a hierarchical level. </p>
        <p>Group forecast models must be carefully built because incorrect choices can inappropriately skew the results and affect many interdependent items and locations. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote" MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">The available sales types that can be selected when building models are the listed types in <span class="Emphasis">tbl_SalesType</span>.</p>
