        <h1>Exponential smoothing</h1>
        <p>This is a dynamic weighted moving averages that calculates the next forecasted point by performing a weighted average on the previous points, where the weights are exponentially decreasing determined by a smoothing factor α. For this, α must be an input parameter. </p>
        <p>Adjusting α to a value closer to 1 tells the forecasting engine that there is more confidence in the recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating the forecast.</p>
