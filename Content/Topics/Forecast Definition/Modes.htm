        <h1>Modes</h1>
        <p>There are three types of modes which relate to the base of the forecast. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Static</span> – As users project, the forecasting engine takes the most recent real data points. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Dynamic</span> – The forecasting engine takes the projected data points and applies them to the forecast as if they were real data points. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Naive (no confidence)</span> – This approach determines that the forecast for any period equals the previous period’s actual value.  </li>
        </ul>
