        <h1>Method processors</h1>
        <p>Processors always come in a pair and can be thought of as a do and then undo adjustment to the series so that the other mechanisms can function properly. They can be used to ignore data or trends in data and then add them back to provide a more accurate forecast. </p>
        <p>An example of a processor would be to ignore seasonality for a long term forecast, then run the method to generate an accurate curve, and finally, re-add the seasonality.</p>
