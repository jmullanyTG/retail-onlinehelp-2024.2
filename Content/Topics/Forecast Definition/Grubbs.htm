        <h1>Grubbs</h1>
        <p>The removal of outliers based on Grubbs’ test for outliers:</p>
        <p>Grubbs' test is based on the assumption of normality. That is, one should first verify that the data can be reasonably approximated by a normal distribution before applying the Grubbs' test.
        </p>
        <p>Grubbs' test detects one outlier at a time. This outlier is expunged from the dataset and the test is iterated until no outliers are detected. However, multiple iterations change the probabilities of detection, and the test should not be used for sample sizes of 6 or less since it frequently tags most of the points as outliers.</p>
