        <h1>Trend</h1>
        <p>The Trend processor rule is commonly used in several forecast methods. It is used to detrend and then retrend the data series. The pre-processor removes any apparent trend from the series and then re-adds it during the post-processor.</p>
        <p>The only default parameter value for the <span class="Emphasis">Trend</span> processor rule is the slope.</p>
