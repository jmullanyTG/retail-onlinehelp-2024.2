        <h1>Moving average with a trend</h1>
        <p>One disadvantage to using a moving average is that it does not deal well with trends or seasonality. The forecasting process uses the modified method of the moving average with a trend. </p>
        <p>It accomplishes this prior to averaging by performing a detrend of the data, which is then reapplied after the average is performed. The moving average with a trend will have a slope.</p>
