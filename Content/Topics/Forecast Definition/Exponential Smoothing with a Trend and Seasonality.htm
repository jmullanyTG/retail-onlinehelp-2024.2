        <h1>Exponential smoothing with a trend and seasonality</h1>
        <p>This method builds upon the exponential smoothing with a trend and adds a third seasonality factor, γ. The smoothing of the seasonality is accomplished by the application of the γ seasonality factor, which will also be a value between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Adjusting γ to a value closer to 1 tells the forecasting engine there is more confidence in the recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating the forecast.</p>
