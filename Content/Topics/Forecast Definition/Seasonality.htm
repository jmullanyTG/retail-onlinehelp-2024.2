        <h1>Seasonality</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Seasonality</span> processor should be applied to deseasonalize and then reseasonalize data on an average seasonal pulse basis. The pre-processor takes any apparent seasonality and removes it from the series, re-adding it during the post-processor. To determine what is deseasonalized, the seasonal sales are calculated by period. For each period, the engine determines a factor by which the data point determined to be higher or lower. It then averages that factor across the entire data series.</p>
        <p>There are no user configurable parameter values for the processor seasonality rule. Seasonality is pre-determined and specified in each particular database.</p>
