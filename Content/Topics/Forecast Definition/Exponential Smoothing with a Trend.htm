        <h1>Exponential smoothing with a trend</h1>
        <p>This method is similar to exponential smoothing, but will perform a detrend of the data and then reapply the trend after the forecast is calculated. This method actually uses the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method and requires the application of a second smoothing constant, β. The smoothing of the trend requires the use of the trend factor β, which will also be a value between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Adjusting β to a value closer to 1 tells the forecasting engine that there is more confidence in the recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating the forecast.</p>
