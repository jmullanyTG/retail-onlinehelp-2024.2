        <h1>Method series rules</h1>
        <p>A series rule is used to modify the entire series of data points (i.e. the whole data set). This constitutes a permanent change to the series. This can be used to account for scenarios such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the addition of safety stock (raising the minimum level of the series), or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> predicting a drop of 10% for all future points.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several method series rules within the forecast order of operations in which the series rule may be executed. Default parameters are presented when a series rule is added and their values can be entered.</p>
        <p>There are several series rules which can be added to a forecasting method. If selected, these rules are placed at an appropriate stage within the order of operations. </p>
        <h2>Series rule stages</h2>
        <p>There are four stages within the order of operations in which a series rule may be applied. This varies depending on the rule and the intention. It is important to understand the steps preceding and following the series rules to properly locate a series rule within the order of operations. </p>
