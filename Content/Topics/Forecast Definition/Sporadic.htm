        <h1>Sporadic</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Sporadic</span> processor rule will only be applicable to data sets with intermittent sales data that would use a predictive method such as Croston Intermittent Demand. The <span class="Emphasis">Sporadic</span> processor averages the number of data points between zeros and adds in (and later removes in the post-processor stage) false data  to allow the Engine to forecast a smooth line.</p>
