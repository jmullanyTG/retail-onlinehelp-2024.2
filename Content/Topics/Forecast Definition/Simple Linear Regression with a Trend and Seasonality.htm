        <h1>Simple linear regression with a trend and seasonality</h1>
        <p>Linear regression is an approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable (y) and one or more explanatory variables (x). </p>
        <p>Simple linear regression is the least squares estimator of a linear regression mode with a single explanatory variable. The calculation takes the least squares fit to the data points, applies any perceived trends and seasonality and then predicts the forecast.</p>
