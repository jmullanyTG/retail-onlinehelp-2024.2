        <h1>Pre-processor</h1>
        <p>The pre-processor is the first segment of a two part mechanism that removes, then re-adds trends in the data or seasonality. The normalization of the data will assist the engine in selecting the best fit method via the tournament by reading the data series without seasonality or any trends. To assure an accurate forecast, the trend or seasonality is added back in as part of the post-processor. The processor pair can be thought of as a do and then undo set of rules. Anything done to the data set via the pre-processor will always be undone at the time of the post-processor application. A pre-processor rule will always have a matching post-processor rule.</p>
