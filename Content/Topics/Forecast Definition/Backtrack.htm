        <h1>Backtrack</h1>
        <p>Backtrack or backcast is the first step taken after the preliminary definitions have been established. Backtrack is a process by which the engine applies its forecasting method to a point earlier in the series.  Backtrack analyzes the historical series and applies a forecast so users can make comparisons to the actual data points further along in the series. Backtrack self-corrects  to better align with the known historical data points.</p>
        <p>For example, if a forecast is beyond a certain current month, such as November, backtrack analyzes the data point from ten months ago (January) and identifies how accurately the forecast would have predicted the known data point five months later (June).</p>
