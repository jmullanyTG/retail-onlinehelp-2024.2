        <h1>Clearing historical logs</h1>
        <p>The Workload Queue Cleanse task clears historical logs that are no longer relevant to current processing nor immediate investigation. In the existing nightly maintenance job, a new task must be configured to cleanse the following workload logs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Archive Log</li>
            <li>Item Log</li>
            <li>Queue Log</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The cleanse task must be scheduled to run during non-regular business hours, daily, outside of the Workload Queue nightly and weekend processing.</p>
