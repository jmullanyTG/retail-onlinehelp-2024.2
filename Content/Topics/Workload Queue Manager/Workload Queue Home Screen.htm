        <h1>Workload Queue home screen</h1>
        <p>After a batch is submitted from a module such as Inventory Forecast or Assortment Planning, the number of items is determined and the estimated workload calculated to set the batch’s priority to be displayed in the Workload Queue <span class="Emphasis">Active</span> list. </p>
        <p>Some batches may be put into a status of <span class="Emphasis">Purgatory </span>because this status contains like items found in a batch, or multiple batches found in later jobs. To maintain efficiency, the system only processes those similar items in the last batch. When the last batch is completed, the system applies the results to the original batch and complete.</p>
        <p>The Workload Queue screen is used to modify the priority of a submitted batch or remove it from being processed. Any modifications to batch priority must be committed and saved. Click <span class="Emphasis">Cancel </span>to revert any modifications to their original state. After a batch has begun execution, its priority cannot be modified further.</p>
        <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Configuration</span> to open the Workload Queue Configuration window.</p>
