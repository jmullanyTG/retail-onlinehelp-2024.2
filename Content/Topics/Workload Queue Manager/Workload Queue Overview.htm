        <h1>Workload Queue Overview</h1>
        <p>To ensure that the system provides results in an expedited manner, Workload Queue processes file batches in the most efficient time frame (daily, nightly, or weekends).</p>
        <p>Each solution (Inventory Forecasting, Assortment Planning, Adaptive Allocations, etc.) has its workload defined at its lowest level. Based on the quantity of batch files at the lowest level, the system calculates the total expected time to process all the files.</p>
        <p>Thresholds are set to determine if the total expected process time will be executed during the day (quick batches), at night (longer batches), or over the weekend (long batches that require an extensive resource usage). </p>
        <p>The priority order in each time frame is based on the submission date and time. Depending on user access and configuration, it is possible to expedite processing batches to the front of the queue.</p>
