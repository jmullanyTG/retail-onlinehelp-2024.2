        <h1>Syncing size model substitutions</h1>
        <p>It is possible to link a site to its override site’s size model so that subsequent changes made to the override site’s curve are reflected in the site it is assigned to. To achieve this link, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the bottom grid of the <span class="Emphasis">Size Models</span> screen, check the <span class="Emphasis">Sync Override</span> field for any site with an override site assigned and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Checking <span class="Emphasis">Sync Override</span> and saving for a site that does not have an assigned Override Site does nothing. The <span class="Emphasis">Sync Override</span> box is unchecked when the screen refreshes.</p>
