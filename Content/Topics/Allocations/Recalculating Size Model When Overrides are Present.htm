        <h1>Recalculating size models when overrides are present</h1>
        <p>Any changes made to sync overrides and to the <span class="Emphasis">Is Eligible?</span> checkboxes, or if there are any overrides present (including size model substitutions) at the time a size model is recalculated, only apply after the overrides are cleared, including size model substitutions. </p>
        <p>However, new size models are still calculated for overridden sites. This is done to avoid having to reinstate changes made to select sites when using new data for sites that have not been overridden.</p>
