        <h1>Size models</h1>
        <p>Size models can be created and applied to product allocations to ensure the correct sizes and size distributions are executed. Size distribution curves can be created based on historical sales or imported and maintained. Size models are saved and may be re-applied to multiple products and by multiple users. </p>
        <p>Size models can more closely estimate future size needs for a group of products by utilizing inventory on-hand data. Thresholds can be set to determine whether a given variant was acceptably in-stock based on the relative importance of each size to a total range and whether that variant had enough in-stock periods to be included in the size model calculation. These thresholds are used to smooth anomalies in the selling data and get to the core sizing needs for groups of products at each site.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sites are always filtered by the configured or allowed channels. For example, if only Retail is allowed, then a location strategy of all sites that can have Retail, E-com, and Outlet channels only returns the Retail specific sites.</p>

        <p>This functionality is built into the Size Models tab and, if the prerequisites are met, applied   when creating a new size model or changing an existing one.

        <h2>Size Model calculation and assigned item rights</h2>
        <p>Users normally create their own size models or use size models generated by a Super User that has access to all items. However, it is important to note that the Size Model calculation runs using the assigned item rights of the user who created the size model and not those assigned to the current active user. This may make a difference to the calculation.</p>
