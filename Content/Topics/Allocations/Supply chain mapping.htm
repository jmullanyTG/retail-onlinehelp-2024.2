        <h1>Supply chain mapping</h1>
        <p>Supply chain mapping is controlled through the <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain Map Configuration</span> maintenance and configuration view. Both <span class="Emphasis">Ongoing Item</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Replenishment</span> strategy selection types share a supply chain. </p>
        <p>The default supply chain for Adaptive Allocations is also controlled within this maintenance view. Values within the <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain Map Configuration</span> view override any default values within a system policy (e.g. <span class="Emphasis">Allocations Default Active Supply Chain</span>).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> It’s important to note if there is a different supply chain mapped to new items versus ongoing items. Also, ensure that the correct AllocateStrategyName has been selected for each Allocation Strategy in which they are generating orders to stores.</p>
