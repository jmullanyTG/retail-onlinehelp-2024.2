        <h1> Multi-tiered alternate sources</h1>
        <p>Supply chains can be configured to include the main distribution center (DC) as an alternate source of stock for the store. </p>

        <p>In this scenario, if the regional DC (DC – US East) is out of stock, the store can request stock directly from the main DC (DC – North America) and circumvent the regional DC. The stock is directly shipped from the main DC to the store with a 16 day lead time.</p>
