        <h1>Product Groups screen</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Product Groups</span> screen is used to distribute inventory outside of the product hierarchy. Users can allocate hierarchy independent collections or sets or deal with mismatched and excess inventory for clearance purposes. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A Product Group is a user configured collection of strategies with each strategy associated with one or more channels. Each product group is represented as a single strategy line within the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen. Product Groups with no included strategies do not display on the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen.</p>
        <p>The lower left section of the <span class="Emphasis">Product Groups</span> screen displays strategies based on the selected filter. Strategies that are within a Product Group do not display on the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen. However, the Product Group with these strategies does display on the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen as a strategy line.</p>
        <p>A strategy cannot be part of more than one Product Group. If a strategy is selected that is already included in another Product Group, then once <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> is clicked the strategy is automatically removed from the other group and included in the group currently worked with. </p>
        <p>However, a <span class="Emphasis">Level ID</span> can have multiple strategies. The different strategies can be included in different Product Groups.</p>
