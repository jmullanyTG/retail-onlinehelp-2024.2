      <h1>Sales plan calculation</h1>
      <p>Several user inputs are required to generate a forward looking sales plan against which allocation orders may be generated. </p>
      <p>The demand type (rate of sale, total sales quantity, etc.) has the largest influence on the magnitude of the sales plan. However, the sales plan basis and any linked manual causals may affect the overall shape of sales over the product lifecycle. </p>
