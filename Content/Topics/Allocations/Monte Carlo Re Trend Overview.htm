        <h1>Monte Carlo Re-Trend Overview</h1>
        <p>The re-trending of forecasts is an important step to correctly manage the continued allocation of products as they transition from a pre-season plan to in-season. As products begin to sell, their sales patterns inevitably trend away from the initial plan (sometimes in the positive, sometimes in the negative). The included re-trend mechanisms in ToolsGroup JustEnough account for the trends in sales and form an amended go-forward sales plan against which continued allocations may be structured. </p>
        <p>With the initial launch of the Allocations solution, a PID mechanism was included to provide a reactive result set based on potentially limited data. With the introduction of the Monte Carlo simulation re-trend mechanism, organizations now have additional tools at their disposal to provide flexibility when dealing with irregular sales patterns. </p>
        <p>Using historical demand for an item, a distribution for the observed demand values can be calculated  using Monte Carlo simulation.&#160; Then a dynamic confidence level is calculated based on the variability of the item’s demand and the number of observations available. </p>
        <p>Using the confidence level and the demand distribution, a total demand value is calculated and compared to the total forecast over the same time frame.</p>
        <p>A re-trend factor is then calculated based on a desired demand satisfaction percentage.</p>
        <h2>Model inputs</h2>
        <p>There are seven inputs into the model:</p>

        <h2>System policies</h2>
        <p>There are several system policies specific to PID. There are also re-trend system policies that are used for both re-trend methods, which can be found below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forecast Model - Maximum Forward Horizon Days</li>
            <li>Sales Day For Selling Item</li>
            <li>Allocations Minimum Retrend Multiplicative Factor</li>
            <li>Allocations Maximum Retrend Multiplicative Factor</li>
            <li>PID - Evaluation Window Size</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although Monte Carlo and PID are different re-trend methods, they both share system policies that help frame where to operate and what bounds to set. There are PID specific parameters (Kp, Ki and Kd) which are not used by Monte Carlo.</p>
        <p>Monte Carlo receives its inputs from the Allocation Strategy as well as through system policies.</p>
