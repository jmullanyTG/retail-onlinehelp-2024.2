      <h1>Exception definitions</h1>
      <p>Exceptions are divided into categories depending on the level of data that is used to calculate the exception. Exceptions can occur at the strategy level when the exception settings are incomplete in the strategy itself, and at an inventory (variant-size/site) level for stocking concerns. These exceptions apply to all types or specific types of allocation strategy selections. </p>
