        <h1>Available to Allocate Calculation method</h1>
        <p>The available to allocate calculation feature is used in many places throughout Allocations. It is a dynamic calculation with several parameters, the inclusion of which will affect how the calculation is accomplished.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>@bIncludeStockOnHand BIT = 1 --Should the StockOnHand column be included? Read from tbl_InventoryLevel</li>
            <li>@bIncludeOnOrder BIT = 1 --Should entries from SupplierOrderLine be included? </li>
            <li>@bIncludePrepacks BIT = 1 --Should stock in prepacks be included? If there are prepacks defined, it goes to the prepacks, then go to the inventory line of the prepacks</li>
            <li>@bIncludeReserved BIT = 0 --Should the Reserved column be accounted for? Stock reserved is currently subtracted from StockOnHand in tbl_InventoryLevel</li>
            <li>@bIncludePending BIT = 1 --Should the Pending column be accounted for?--subtracted if included</li>
            <li>@bIncludeSuperceded BIT = 1 --Should the Superseded column be accounted for? – added if included</li>
            <li>
                <p>@iTodayDays INT = NULL --Number of days from today to be considered as available </p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Uses system policy <span class="Emphasis">Available Orders Window</span> if null. </p>
            </li>
            <li>@dToday DATETIME = NULL --defines <span class="Emphasis">Today</span>, uses actual today if null</li>
            <li>@bPrepackOnly BIT = 0 --Return only prepack stock ignoring all others</li>
            <li>
                <p>@iLateDays INT = NULL --How many days back from today to look at late orders and include them.</p>

            </li>
            <li>@bOnOrderOnly BIT = 0 --Return only on order stock ignoring all others</li>
