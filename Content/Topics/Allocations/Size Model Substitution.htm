        <h1>Size model substitution</h1>
        <p>When size models are calculated, it is not uncommon for some sites to have sub-optimal curves caused by poor size availability, poor overall sales, or lack of data for stores that do not yet have enough data to support generation of their own curves. To address this,  the curve of one site can be substituted for another and updates synchronized to substituted curves. Additionally, curves can be manually edited.</p>
