        <h1>Allocation strategy parameters</h1>
        <p>Allocation strategy filters narrow the focus of the Allocation Strategy screen to  help with the allocation strategy work flow. </p>
        <h2>Item filter </h2>
        <p>An item master level filter that displays the selected variants to the Allocation Strategy screen. Also, the filter manager wizard can be launched directly from the Allocation Strategy screen to build a new filter or edit an existing filter. </p>
        <h2>Strategy filter</h2>
        <p>Any exception that occurs at the strategy level can be included in a filter for the Allocation Strategy screen. Many of these exceptions are blocked, which means that no action may be taken with the strategy until they are addressed. These strategy filter conditions are organized by group and are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        <h2>Display items below thresholds</h2>
        <p>Unselected by default. If the <span class="Emphasis">Display Items Below Thresholds</span> checkbox is not selected, then strategies containing items which do not meet criteria defined by an Exception do not display in the Allocation Strategy grid. This streamlines work flows by eliminating strategies with minimal stock. If selected, then all the strategies in the filter display.</p>
