      <h1>About the setup and configuration of the Allocations module</h1>
      <p>As the Allocations module can be set up to accommodate several different types of business processes, the initial setup and configuration tasks can be a moderate to significant volume of work. Hierarchies must be configured, system policies must be defined, and certain data elements must be imported or otherwise maintained in the application.Â  </p>
      <p>Table definitions and hierarchy configuration must be completed before system policy settings can be configured.</p>
