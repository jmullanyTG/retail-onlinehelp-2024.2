      <h1>Total push and push quantity calculations</h1>
      <p>Total push demand type operates in two distinct modes: if push quantity is set (constrained) and if it is left blank (total push). </p>
      <p>Push logic prioritizes stock movement out of the DC over store specific constraints and/or ideal stock levels, but it fills to ideal levels if at all possible. Push calculations are not a function of the Allocations Engine, which produces allocation order recommendations for all other demand types. </p>
