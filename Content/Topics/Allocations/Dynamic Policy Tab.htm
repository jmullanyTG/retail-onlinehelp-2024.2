        <h1>Using inventory policies to manage minimum safety stock</h1>
        <p>Dynamic safety stock policies associated with Allocation Strategies display in the <span class="Emphasis">Dynamic Policy</span> blade in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> view. This blade has two sections: <span class="Emphasis">Inventory</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Policy</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Dynamic Policy Tab.PNG" class="LargeImages" /> </p>
        <p>Inventory policies can be used to manage minimum safety stock within Allocation Strategies. Using dynamic minimum safety stock policy values for allocation managed items more effectively manages both minimum safety stock values over time and safety stock at the SKU-location level.
</p>
        <p>
An Allocation Strategy can have multiple dynamic safety stock policies for different time frames with all the policies being taken into account. The Allocation Strategy goes back to the normal stock holding pattern once a policy's end date has been reached. Navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Stock Holding Projection</span> blade in Inventor Manager to see the impact of dynamic safety stock policies.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">

The dynamic policy values are managed in the Policy module.</p>
        <p>

The <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> grid has a column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Dynamic SS Policies</span>. The checkbox in this column provides a convenient way to quickly scroll through the displayed strategies to find strategies that have associated dynamic safety stock policies. If the checkbox is checked, then there are associated dynamic safety stock policies. If unchecked, there are no dynamic safety stock policies.
