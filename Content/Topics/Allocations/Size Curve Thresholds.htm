        <h1>Size curve thresholds</h1>
        <p>The Percent Covered threshold is used to specify a percentage of sizes that must have been in-stock at a site on a given period for a variant for the corresponding sales from that period to be included in the size model calculation for that site. The threshold is applied as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>As not all sizes carry equal importance at a given site, the system determines the relative importance of each size present in the selected Size Range for each site by summing the uncleansed sales by size for all items in the selected Filter and date range then dividing by the sum of sales for all sizes.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, each period in the selected date range is evaluated against the set Percent Covered threshold. The % contribution of all sizes in stock for each variant at that site are summed and compared to the Percent Covered threshold. If the sum value is equal or greater, the sales for that variant/period are included in the size model calculation for that site. If not, they are removed.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Weeks Covered</h2>
        <p>The Weeks Covered threshold is used to specify a minimum number of periods that a variant must have been in-stock at a given site for its sales to be included in the size model calculation for that site. When paired with a Percent Covered threshold, this threshold is applied after any periods that did not pass the Percent Covered threshold are removed. The threshold is applied as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The system evaluates each period for each variant to see if it was acceptably in-stock at the site. If no Percent Covered threshold is specified, the system checks if there was stock on-hand in any size for each period.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In-stock periods are then counted for each variant and compared to the Weeks Covered threshold. Variants with counts equal to or greater than the threshold are included in the size model calculation for that site. Variants with lower counts are removed. </p>

        <h2>Size model calculations without cleansing thresholds</h2>
        <p>Building on the examples displayed above, the following is the outcome based on the data displayed and then compared to how the system  calculated the size model without the application of the cleansing thresholds:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The example above shows total sales by variant by size after the Percent Covered Threshold is applied. <span class="Emphasis">X</span> indicates the weeks to be included in the totals. Additionally, the green section at the bottom shows the final sales totals after the Weeks Covered threshold is applied. The sales for variant 3 are also not included, because it did not have enough in-stock weeks to meet the threshold.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the example above, both curves are weighted heavier in the smaller end of the size spectrum, but there are definite differences between the two outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The uncleansed data weighted the fringe sizes (S and XXL) heavier than their cleansed counterparts</li>
            <li>The uncleansed data shows size S to be the biggest sales contributor, whereas the cleansed data shows size L as the clear winner</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Comparing the resulting size model with the curve generated by using sales alone, without any cleansing. </h2>
        <p>Whether the cleansed data represents the actuality or not really depends on the nuances of the business. The purpose of data cleansing is to provide a data set that is representative of consistent normal selling trends without anomalies to skew the result. </p>
        <p>In this case, customers may have gravitated toward sizes that are not their ideal because of stock outages. If true, it means that the data cleansing prevents over-ordering in fringe sizes and repeating the same stock outage problems in sizes that are more important under normal circumstances. Identifying the proper threshold settings for optimal size model generation may require some trial and error. Done properly, it can help avoid lost sales due to insufficient stock by size and minimize the need for post-allocation transfer activities.  </p>
