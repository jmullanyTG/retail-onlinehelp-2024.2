        <h1>Preventing the creation and activation of inventories</h1>
        <p>System policy <span class="Emphasis">Allow Allocations to Create and/or Activate Inventory</span> gives users the ability to set restrictions that effectively limit the automatic creation and activation of inventories that are associated with Allocation Strategies. Users have enhanced flexibility and control, ensuring inventory management aligns more closely with specific business needs and operational preferences.</p>
        <p style="color: #FF0000;" class="Caution">This system policy must be managed with great care. If the system policy is set the <span class="Emphasis">False</span>, then it is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure appropriate inventory management. Improper management can lead to orders not being recommended correctly.</p>
