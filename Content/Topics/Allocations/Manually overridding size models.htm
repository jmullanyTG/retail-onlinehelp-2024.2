        <h1>Manually overriding size models</h1>
        <p>It is also possible to override a site’s curve via manual entry. In the bottom grid of the <span class="Emphasis">Size Models</span> screen.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click in the cell of the site and size whose contribution percentage is to be changed.</li>
            <li>Enter the desired value.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BasicNote"> A manual change to a site with an assigned Override Site also clears the <span class="Emphasis">Sync Override</span> checkbox if it was checked.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">When rebalancing a curve based on manual changes, the system attempts to retain all entered Contribution values for a given site’s curve. However, it is possible the system  changes entered values to balance to 100%. For example, user entered changes to the values for all sizes mean the total curve does not equal 100%.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Manual Size Curve Overrides.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Any override site is cleared. By making a manual change, the curve deviates from the override site’s curve values and substitutes a manual curve in its place.</p>
