        <h1>Clearing substitutions and other size model overrides</h1>
        <p>Any overrides made to a site’s size curve, including size curve substitutions, can be cleared reverting the curve back to its originally calculated values.</p>
        <p> In the bottom grid of the <span class="Emphasis">Size Models</span> screen:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Check the <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> field of any site where the field is highlighted in orange. </p>
                <p>Orange indicates an override is present.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Clearing Substitutions and Other Size Curve Overrides.png" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The contribution values of the site now revert back to their original calculated values. Any Override Sites that were assigned to the sites are cleared. </p>
        <p>Any sites that were assigned the site that had its overrides cleared as an Override Site and also had the <span class="Emphasis">Sync Override</span> box checked revert back to the Override Site’s original values.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> Changes to the <span class="Emphasis">Is Eligible?</span> checkboxes of a site that had overrides cleared revert to their original state.</p>
