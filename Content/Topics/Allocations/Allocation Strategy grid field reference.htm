        <h1>Allocation Strategy field reference</h1>
        <p>The following fields are available on the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Active Flag</span> – Checked if the strategy is currently active.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Actual Rate of Sale</span> – Actualized rate of sale based on sales history. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Allocate Strategy ID</span> – A unique identifier for the strategy line. Any active product groups are assigned a unique allocate strategy ID. </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy Selection</span> – Defines the strategy bucket used to classify the strategy. Typically, these strategy selections are determined by product life cycle status. This field drives which exceptions are triggered, how some of the settings are applied, and which process (Allocations or Replenishment) manages the item. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">New Item</span> – An item without sales history, or with a minimal volume of sales history data which has been deemed insufficient to drive allocation measures. <span class="Emphasis">New Item</span> can be used to drive initial load supply chains (e.g. circumventing regional distribution centers). The individual supply chain mapping configuration for the different strategy selection values is maintained in the Supply Chain Map Configuration maintenance view. New Items are managed by the Allocations engine.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Ongoing Item</span> – An item which has multiple points of sales history data. This item can have a re-trending method applied to the sales projection. Ongoing items are managed by the Allocations engine.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Replenishment</span> – An item which no longer needs to be managed at the strategy level and can be put on an automated replenishment strategy. Replenishment items are managed by the Replenishment engine, which takes over responsibility from the Allocations engine for executing processes and providing item-related information. The strategy line is read-only when this option is selected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> -  Whether there is one or more channels depends on whether an omni-channel strategy is allowed. If allowed, then one strategy can have multiple channels. If an omni-channel environment is not allowed, then the strategy is broken down into multiple strategies each with 1 channel. </p>
                <p>A new strategy is always created when a strategy is activated using <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view. To add channels in existing strategies without going into the <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view and creating unwanted strategies, click within this field and select the ellipsis to display the <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> dialog. The <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> dialog is used to add and remove channels as needed. </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Allow Reservation</span> – Ensures that all stores that were set up to have reservation quantities receive their reserved stock quantities.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Calculate Allocation</span> – Formatted in orange if there are changes made to the allocation strategy. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Channels In Use</span> -  The channel or channels associated with the strategy. Which channels are allowed displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> field.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> – (For users with the Site Clustering module) Location strategies may be defined by selecting specific site grades within cluster sets (cluster sets must be configured for use with Allocations). A location strategy value of <span class="Emphasis">Cluster based all sites</span> must be set to use cluster sets to define the effective location strategy. Location exceptions are still applicable. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Cluster Site Manager/Viewing Collection Set Configuration.htm">Configuring a cluster collection  set</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Code</span> – The identifying code for the level ID associated with the strategy. This is the item master group code of the hierarchical level defined in the allocation hierarchy. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Create Save Point</span> – Creates a Save Point. </p>
                <p>All the information relating to the strategy including location exceptions is saved. Users can then go to the <span class="Emphasis">Allocate Strategy Save Point</span> screen and mass apply a Save Point to all the variants in the Item Filter.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Demand Rate of Sale</span> – The rate of sale currently being applied to the phase period (defined as the period between the phase-in date or current date and the phase-out date). </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Demand Type</span> – Determines the driver for the demand signal. This setting also determines which fields within the allocation strategy are and are not relevant to shaping the demand signal. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Total Sales Quantity</span> – Input the Total Sale Demand Units for the Phase In / Phase Out period. This value is used to determine the average weekly ROS by spreading it across the stores and weeks between the Phase In / Phase Out.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> – For use with rate of sale type plans. </li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Total Available Quantity</span> – Allocation based on total available quantity while protecting the size curve.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="Emphasis">Total Push</span> – Allocates all available inventory in the selected inventory sources at one time.  A specific quantity to push can be designated by entering a value in the <span class="Emphasis">Push Qty</span> field. </p>
                        <p>Total push demand type prioritizes the movement of stock from the DC and violates store level constraints or ideal stock quantities such as phase in, phase out, and max stock. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale by Grade</span> – (For users with access to the Rate of Sale Calculator module) A rate of sale value by cluster grade can be applied to individual locations. A location strategy of cluster based must be specified, and site clusters must be selected to define the location strategy for this demand type. Included grades by cluster set must be configured within the allocate cluster rate of sale view.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Description</span> – A description accompanying the code. This is the item master group description of the hierarchical level defined in the allocation hierarchy.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Dynamic SS&#160;Policies</span> - (read-only) If the checkbox is checked, then the strategy has dynamic safety stock policies. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Eligible Channel</span> – A configurable named site group, or the explicit channel attribute. Additional site groups may be returned as required. Informational only. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Engine Run Date</span> – A date field showing the last time the allocation strategy was calculated.</li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Exception Status</span> – If required configuration elements are missing from the strategy or if it is ready to allocate. If there are no blocking exceptions, then <span class="Emphasis">Ready to Allocate</span> displays. </p>
                <p>To view exceptions, click within the <span class="Emphasis">Exception Status</span> field and then click <span class="Emphasis">View</span> to launch the <span class="Emphasis">Allocations Strategy Exceptions</span> dialog.</p>

                <h3>Constrained situations
</h3>
                <p>					In Allocations, users can decide what to do in a constrained situation with the following:

					</p>
                <p>Coverage (aka order multiple) → Safety Stock (aka presentation) → Demand

					</p>
                <p>Demand → Safety stock 

					</p>
                <p>Safety Stock → Demand (Also this is the only option for Replenishment Runs)
</p>
                <p>It is important to note that the Engine uses the term <span class="Emphasis">Need</span> which comprises of multiple components such as Coverage/SS/Demand to determine what each site is requesting to generate recommended orders. 

					</p>
                <p class="Example">Site 1 could have a Need of 25 but the Engine sees that as a Coverage = 5, SS = 8, and Demand = 12, where Site 2’s Need = 25, but Coverage=8, SS=15, Demand=2</p>
