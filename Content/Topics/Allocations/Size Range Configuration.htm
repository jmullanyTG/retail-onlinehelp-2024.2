        <h1>Size range configuration</h1>
        <p>Size range data must be imported as part of the size range feed. Size ranges differ from size models in that a range is a container for all possible sizes which may be included in a curve. Ranges may be reused for multiple location specific curves and contribution levels are stored as part of a curve, and not as part of a range. </p>
        <p>Configuration of size ranges can also be done through the <span class="Emphasis">Size Range Manager</span> blade in Variant Manager. After a size model is linked to a range, the range cannot be altered or deleted. </p>
        <p>Upon creation of a size range, a default curve is automatically generated to prevent possibilities of torn data. The default curve value can be replaced as the default curve with a user calculated curve, if desired. </p>
