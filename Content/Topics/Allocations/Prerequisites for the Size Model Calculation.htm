        <h1>Prerequisites for the size model calculation</h1>
        <p>The following are prerequisites that must be met for the size model calculation to run:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Stock On-hand Data by Site/Size</span>: the size model calculation makes use of stock on-hand data to qualify whether the sales that occurred for a given variant/period should be included when calculating a size model for a given site. If this data is not present for the items included in the product filter selected for the size model, the enhanced calculation method cannot be employed and the old sales-only calculation method is used instead</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Data Cleansing Thresholds</span>: at least one of the two data cleansing threshold fields must be set to a positive value. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Size Curve Thresholds.htm">Data Cleansing Thresholds</MadCap:xref>.</p>
