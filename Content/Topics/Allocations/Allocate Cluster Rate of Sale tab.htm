        <h1>Rate of sale (ROS) by grade demand type</h1>
        <p>For allocation strategies that use the rate of sale by grade demand type, the included rate of sale grades must be selected and applied. Using the <span class="Emphasis">Allocate Cluster Rate of Sale</span> tab, the need to associate a location strategy with an allocation strategy can be bypassed. This feature further enhances the integrated process of assortment plans carrying into allocation strategies.</p>
        <p>In its most simple form, the rate of sale is set to what is achievable for each one for the grades by setting the rate of sale override in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocate Cluster Rate of Sale</span> tab for each allocation strategy.</p>
        <p>Field descriptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Included</span> – If selected, the cluster set rate of sale grades is included. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set</span> – The description of the cluster set. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Classification</span> – The value of the classification/grade to be included or excluded. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Calculated Rate of Sale</span> – The ROS value for the grade as calculated by the Rate of Sale Calculator. This is the value which has been pushed to the strategy. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Rate of Sale Calculator/Rate of Sale Calculator Overview.htm">Rate of Sale overview</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly"> For more information, refer to the Rate of Sale User Guide.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale Override</span> – The by grade user override rate of sale value. If present, this is used instead of the calculated rate of sale. </li>
