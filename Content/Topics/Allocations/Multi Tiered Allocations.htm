      <h1>Multi-tiered allocations</h1>
      <p>Organizations that wish to use regional or other intermediary distribution centers can configure supply chains which trigger order recommendations from the eligible sources of stock to the appropriate stores or sales channels with multiple tiers configured in the supply chain. </p>

      <p>With multiple tiers configured, stock is drawn from secondary/regional DCs to fulfil store need and secondary/regional request fulfilment from the main DC within the same strategy calculation run. </p>
