        <h1>Supersession Overview</h1>
        <p>For new items, supersessions can be used to create demand forecasts and replenish old item inventory with the new items.</p>
        <h2>Forecasting supersessions </h2>
        <p>To forecast demand for a new item that has no sales history of its own, the sales data of a similar existing item can be used to generate a demand forecast for the new item. Forecasting supersessions copy the month-to-month sales history of an existing item to  the new item so that a demand forecast can be made for the new item. </p>
        <p>The new demand forecast can then be used to create purchase orders for the new item, ensuring  new products are delivered to the right stores at the right time in the right quantities.</p>
        <h2>Replenishment supersessions</h2>
        <p>When it is time to replace an old&#160;item with its new replacement item (such as when a new model is available), use replenishment supersessions to gradually replenish or immediately replace the old item inventory with the new item. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Replenishment supersessions do not start allocating new replacement items until there is no stock available for the previous item. </p>
