        <h1>Allow Override Of Validation Failures</h1>
        <p>Provides access to mark the <span class="Emphasis">Override</span> checkbox for a failed Promotion Validation (i.e. Information, Warning, Error) in the Promotion Validation Log. Overriding a Promotion Validation error replaces the Validation failure severity icon with the 'Failure Reviewed' icon to visually identify to users that a Validation Failure exists but has already been 'approved'.</p>
