        <h1>Roles</h1>
        <p>Roles may be thought of as a preset group of rights which may apply to more than one user. Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Roles</span> button in the <span class="Emphasis">Navigation Menu</span> displays the current roles list. Role names and descriptions are listed here. </p>

        <h2>Accessing detailed information about Roles</h2>
        <p>Much of the detailed information related to the roles is found in the <span class="Emphasis">Role Information</span> window which is accessed by either double clicking on an existing role or highlighting a role and clicking <span class="Emphasis">Create</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Modify</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Clone Role</span>.</p>

        <h3>The Role Information window</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Memberships</span> tab displays included and excluded users. User membership can be maintained here or in the individual user accounts.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Rights</span> tab lists rights specifically included or excluded from roles. Any included rights are granted to all users listed in the memberships section. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">There is no need to grant those users the same rights in their individual user rights sections if the necessary rights are assigned to the role.</p>
        <h3>Field descriptions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Role Name</span> – The name of the role. </p>
                <p class="BasicNote">It is considered best practice to keep the names generalized when creating new roles. </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Description</span> – A high level description of the role.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Roles tab within the users and rights sections</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Roles</span> tab within the <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Rights</span> sections of the <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> module allow administrators to add  roles to user accounts. </p>
