        <h1>User details</h1>
        <p>Users are created, cloned, modified, and deleted within the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span> window. Select <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Navigation</span> menu and then choose the desired functionality to display the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span> window.</p>
        <h2>User Details tab</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">User Details</span> tab contains most of the general information common to user accounts such as login credentials and assigned filters. Assigned filters give Administrators the ability to segment sections of the company data to restrict users or streamline their individual workflows. Users may be assigned filters built on specific inventories, sites, item masters and many other filter types. </p>

        <h2>Cloning users</h2>
        <p>Cloning a user is a shortcut used when setting up new users. It is advisable to do this instead of creating a new user, as similar rights, roles and filters (the most time consuming part of user account setup) may be carried over.</p>
