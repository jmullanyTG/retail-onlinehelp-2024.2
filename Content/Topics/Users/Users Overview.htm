        <h1>Users Overview</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> module is an administrative tool used to set up user rights, roles, and groups for a particular module and sub-sections of modules. Roles can be configured with required rights, and users belonging to that role will inherit those rights. Further specific right configuration per user can be applied from that point.</p>
        <h2>Users tab</h2>
        <p>Administrators manage individual user accounts within the <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> tab of the navigation menu. Tasks such as account creation, information manipulation, account deletion, and assignment of rights and roles are all accomplished in the <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> tab.</p>
        <p>The main screen displays the current active users list and high level information that differentiates the individual user accounts. </p>
        <h2>Accessing detailed user account information</h2>
        <p>Most tasks which can be accomplished in the <span class="Emphasis">Users</span> tab are completed using the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span>  window which has detailed information related to user accounts. To access the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span> window: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> double click on an existing user account or highlight a user account and click <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> in the navigation pane</li>
            <li>create a new user by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Create</span> in the navigation pane, or </li>
            <li>highlight a specific user account and click <span class="Emphasis">Clone User</span> in the navigation pane. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Assign Roles</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Assign Rights</span> functions also launch the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span> window.</p>
        <h2>Column descriptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User Name</span> – The name for the user account. If it is a domain user, the name is preceded by the domain (domain\user).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User Description</span> – A description of the user account. If it is a cloned user, the description reads as <span class="Emphasis">Cloned from _____</span> until it is changed (the blank is filled by the user account from which it was cloned).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User Access Group</span> – Defines the access group to which the user belongs.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Active</span> - (default is hidden) Whether the user is currently active. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Role Names</span> - (default is hidden) A list of the roles to which the user belongs. This lets System Administrators ensure that role memberships are aligned with business responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
