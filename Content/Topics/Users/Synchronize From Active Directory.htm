        <h1>Synchronizing from active directory</h1>
        <p>If desired, users and roles can be maintained based on active directory entries in a particular domain. This should be done only with consultation with the client IT department. </p>
        <p>Standard practice when syncing with active directory is to leave the <span class="Emphasis">Enhanced Mode</span> checkbox unchecked. </p>

        </p>
        <p>If the desired results are not returned, the synchronization may be run in enhanced mode to circumvent the API. It is not recommended for use unless absolutely required.</p>
