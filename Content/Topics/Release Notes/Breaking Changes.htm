        <h1>Breaking Changes</h1>
        <h2>Inventory </h2>
        <p>The exceedingly old and replaced pair of tables, <span class="Emphasis">tbl_ArchiveInventory</span> and <span class="Emphasis">tbl_ArchiveInventoryStatus</span>, having been deprecated since JE 3.5.2.2, are explicitly excluded from any Purge activities.  In addition, the database Foreign Key linking the former to the core <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Inventory</span> table has been removed (DROPped) and will not be reinstated.  Any custom code still referencing these tables ought to be eliminated entirely.</p>
        <p>Any custom or TG JE support developed Inventory Purge procedures <span class="Emphasis">must be removed immediately and never reinstated</span>.  The new Inventory Purge supports purge of data from both TG JE core and any custom tables using <span class="Emphasis">InventoryID</span>.  Using any other purge mechanism is unsupported and is undertaken at the user’s own risk.</p>
