        <h1>Assortment Planning</h1>
        <h2>Using a price matrix with Smart Start within AP</h2>
        <p>TG JE Assortment Planning v2024.1 introduced the TG JE Price Matrix to better support planning in multiple currencies. TG JE v2024.2 extends this functionality into Assortment Planning Smart Start. (Smart Start is not enabled for the standalone Target Choice Count module.)</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Please refer to the TG JE v2024.1 release notes for an extensive description of TG JE's ability to plan in multiple currencies via a Price Matrix.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of TG JE Price Matrix, the AP Smart Start process has been updated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">AUT Discount %</span> step has been changed to occur earlier in the process</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>derived values are not seeded</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">
                <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Apply</span> procedure runs instead of <span class="Emphasis">Reconcile</span> to derive <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> and <span class="Emphasis">AUR</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>there are no VAT conversions if Price Matrix functionality is enabled</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> and <span class="Emphasis">AUR</span> are derived from a <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>. 

This means that the Smart Started <span class="Emphasis">AUR</span> value is not guaranteed to match the planned scenario <span class="Emphasis">AUR</span>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> metric has been added to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> <span class="Emphasis">Historical</span> section on the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Management</span> screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Image view</span> (<span class="Emphasis">View Options</span> &gt; <span class="Emphasis">Quick Text</span> drop-down menu).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Managing attribute-based sub-clusters across views</h2>
        <p>Existing sub-clustering functionality allows users, via Cluster Sets view, to grade and cluster (ABC) store cluster sets based on sales performance and then sub-cluster by a site-specific Lookup attribute type (such as Cold, Hot, Warm), including user defined attributes. The result is adjustments to phase periods based on site attributes. The sub-clustering functionality is now extended to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Receipt Plan view</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sales Plan view</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Top Down Core Plan view</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">An in-depth description on sub-clustering, including configuring AP to use attribute sub-clusters, is available by referring to the TG JE v2022.2 Release Notes.</p>
