        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>For TG JE v2024.1, ToolsGroup&#160;JustEnough continues to emphasize security with improvements. Additionally, as password management is now outside of the TG&#160;JE system being managed by Auth0, the fields on the <span class="Emphasis">User Information</span> screen allowing users to change the login password have been removed and replaced with the following wording <span class="Emphasis">User password managed outside of system</span>. </p>
