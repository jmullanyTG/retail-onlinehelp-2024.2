        <h2>Secure Single Sign On (SSO) with Auth0</h2>
        <p>For ToolsGroup JustEnough v2022.3 onwards, ToolsGroup&#160;JustEnough has selected Auth0 as its Single Sign On (SSO) solution. Auth0 is an authentication and authorization platform that provides a highly secure environment in which users sign-in with their email address and password or choose to continue if they have already signed in to another application such as Gmail or Microsoft Office 365. This eliminates the need for repeated system sign-ins for an improved user experience and simplifies the management of user names and passwords for organizations.</p>
        <p>Auth0 verifies whether users are authorized to access ToolsGroup JustEnough using credentials provided by third-party Identity Providers such as Google, Okta, or Microsoft. All user management including the configuration and authentication of email addresses is handled by Auth0  while passwords are managed by either Auth0 or the third-party Identity Provider.</p>
        <p>Users are presented with Auth0's Universal Login when signing-in.</p>

        <p>Auth0's Universal Login is customizable allowing organizations to display their own logo and colors as well as any desired wording along with the ability to offer one or more integrated SSO solutions. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The full capabilities and benefits of Auth0's Universal Login and SSO functionality can be reviewed by following this link: <a href="https://auth0.com/single-sign-on">Single Sign On</a>.</p>
        <h3>Deprecation of Identity API and NameServer</h3>

This deprecation involves a Breaking Change. For more information, refer to the <cite>Single Sign On (SSO) with Auth0</cite> section in Breaking Changes.</p>
