        <p> Select new Attribute Type <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Attribute</span>, via either the <span class="Emphasis">Add Attribute</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Edit Attribute</span> dialogs, to specify a site-level MFP plan as a sales attribute and a time range to be used in conjunction to cluster sites with. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The hybrid MFP plans listed are those plans that are in status <span class="Emphasis">Initialized</span>, <span class="Emphasis">In Progress</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Authorized</span>. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The hybrid MFP plans must have the exactly the same product hierarchy levels down to the selected clustering level. These plans can have lower levels of the product hierarchy as well but can’t be at a higher level than the required clustering. Time range selections need to be within the time range of the financial plan.</p>
