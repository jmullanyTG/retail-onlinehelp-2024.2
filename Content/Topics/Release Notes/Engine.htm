        <h1>Engine</h1>
        <p>A new API endpoint is now available on all of the engines that can take a sample of the host's current system usage such as Memory% and CPU% every minute (configurable with the node update timer) and store it in the compute manager. This will be consumed when creating reports showing task progress and how each system was being used during the task run.</p>
