        <h1>Site Manager </h1>
        <p>Previously, Variant Manager supported additional attributes that Site Manager did not. With TG JE v2024.2, Site Manager has been enhanced to make the two modules consistent.</p>
        <p>The newly supported attribute types in Site Manager are DateTime, True/False, Integers, Floats, Short Text and Long Text. So, for example, users can add an attribute for Store Size (integer), Checkout Count (integer), Prime Store (True/False), Store Expected Revamp (DateTime), and so on.</p>
