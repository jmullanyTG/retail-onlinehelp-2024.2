        <h1>Site Manager </h1>
        <p>Improvements have been made to Site Manager. Now users can configure multiple enterable attributes in addition to the existing support for Lookup Attributes. This brings Site Manager into line with supported Variant Manager functionality. </p>
        <p>The newly supported attribute types in Site Manager are DateTime, True/False, Integers, Floats, Short Text and Long Text. So, for example, users can add an attribute for Store Size (integer), Checkout Count (integer), Prime Store (True/False), Store Expected Revamp (DateTime), and so on.</p>
