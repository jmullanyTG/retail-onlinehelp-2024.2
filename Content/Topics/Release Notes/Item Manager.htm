        <h2>Method set frequency values</h2>
        <p>A Level Forecast configuration table has been created which looks at method set frequency values. If the values pass the threshold defined by the system policy, the values will be written. If the values don’t pass the threshold, the values will be removed. The histogram aggregation would take place, and the rows at the bottom of the table indicate the selection by the histogram for each level.</p>
