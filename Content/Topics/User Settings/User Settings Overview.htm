        <h3>Plugin Folders</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Plugin Folders Configuration</span> window lets users specify the location of a particular folder which contains the desired version of the plugins.</p>
        <p>Entries may be added or deleted using the navigation buttons at the bottom of the window.</p>
        <p>To reload plugins, users must log out of ToolsGroup JustEnough and then log back in. If the plugins are not loading, make sure to check that there are valid plugin files contained within the file path.</p>
        <h3>Refresh Plugins</h3>
