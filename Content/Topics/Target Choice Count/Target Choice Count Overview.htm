        <h1>Target Choice Count Overview</h1>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span> is a standalone version of the Target Creation functionality found within Assortment Planning (AP). The main differences between <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span> and AP is that for <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span>, the settings come from system policies and the Variant entity is being used. For AP, the settings come from the AP plan and it is the Variant Placeholder entity being used.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">While this capability is included within the standard Assortment Planning solution, Target Choice Count can be licensed separately. This gives customers the ability to take advantage of intelligent recommendations when creating assortments even if they do not use the Assortment Planning module.</p>
        <p>The main view is read-only. Changes are made by selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button and using the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> screen to make desired changes.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Traditional planning tools are typically rigid in the way users are allowed to plan: by product and site hierarchy only. This has led to many retailers attempting to gain detail by further extending their hierarchies, but this approach still does not offer true flexibility to adjust strategy as often as desired based on the changing needs of the business. 
</p>
        <p>Target Choice Count offers the ability to segment hierarchy levels by a wide array of product attributes, both qualitative and quantitative, and then further subdivide and define plan targets and desired new choice counts all the way down to a site group, cluster, or site level.
</p>
        <p>Target Creation allows for:
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>creating scenarios in as simple or complex as manner as desired.</li>
            <li>
linking scenarios to existing merchandise financial plans, or basing plan targets on specified historical period.</li>
            <li>
defining business segments by product hierarchy or based on innumerable variables defined through product filters.</li>
            <li>
modeling new areas of business, adjusting percent contributions and planning targets at aggregate or more granular levels through the Pivot Grid functionality, and calculating recommended new choice counts based on targets through Rationalization (a marginal return curve calculation that suggests optimal assortment breadth and depth based on cleansed historical data).
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>Use the following parameters to filter the displayed Targets:</p>
