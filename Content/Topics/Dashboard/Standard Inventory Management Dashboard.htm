        <h1>Standard inventory management dashboard</h1>
        <p>The default dashboard covers basic inventory management metrics and may be actioned upon based on the presentation of certain exceptions. </p>
        <p>The standard dashboard presents four widgets, all of which are designed to give an overview of their inventory situation and highlight any exceptions which may require the attention of the user.</p>
        <p>

        <h2>Setup of the standard dashboard</h2>
        <p>Much of the setup of the standard dashboard is done within the <span class="Emphasis">Views</span> module. For overall help in using the <span class="Emphasis">Views</span> module, refer to the online help.</p>
        <h2>Widget definitions</h2>
