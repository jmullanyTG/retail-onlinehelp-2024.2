        <h1>Demand plan target values derived from strategic financial plans</h1>
        <p>As financial target values are stored at a higher levels of the hierarchy in Merchandise Financial Planning, demand plan target values derived from strategic financial plans require additional logic to correctly disaggregate the values. </p>
        <p>For the given example, the strategic plan weekly values are as follows:</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the time frame (set via <span class="Emphasis">Plan Length</span> in a linked scenario plan) was set in such a way to cover weeks 1-7, the total need target would be $10,000.00. Once a location strategy is applied, the total need target is distributed across all locations based product model factors. </p>
