        <h1>Demand plans</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Demand Plan</span> section within Adaptive Allocations determines the source for calculated variant-store targets before variants are even selected. As the logical first step in the process, creating and establishing a demand plan helps drive the subsequent decisions throughout the creation of the scenario. </p>
        <p>Demand plans are generated from one of four potential sources: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan</span> – A strategic merchandise financial plan. The output of this planning process is a by period target value for a segment of the product hierarchy. This can be further segmented with a location dimension, but the specificity of a by store plan is usually reserved for location planning. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Plan</span> – A by store merchandise financial plan. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Rolling WOC</span> – A calculated rolling weeks of cover value, based on sampled sales history. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User Target Value</span> – A manual entry for a need target. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When creating a demand plan, users are prompted to select one of these possible demand sources. The configuration screen then updates with the relevant input parameters for the selected demand source. </p>
