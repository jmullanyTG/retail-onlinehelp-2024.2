      <h1>Attribute weighting </h1>
      <p>As part of the attribute inclusion process, users are prompted to supply a weighting factor which is used to determine the importance of the attribute within the draft process versus the other included attributes. All values default to <span class="Emphasis">100%</span> which means that they are evenly weighted. </p>
