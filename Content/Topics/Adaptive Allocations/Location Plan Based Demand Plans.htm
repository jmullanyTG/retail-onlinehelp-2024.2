        <h1>Hybrid plan based demand plans</h1>
        <p>In Location Planning, financial targets are created for levels of the product hierarchy down to store level. The creation of a hybrid plan based demand plan, within Adaptive Allocations, is similar to that of strategic financial planning. However, there is no need for a product model as store level indexing is not necessary. </p>
        <p>For the given example, the location plan values are as follows:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Adaptive Allocations/Mens_Shirts_Location Plans.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The time frame (set via <span class="Emphasis">Plan Length</span> in a linked scenario plan) was set in such a way to include weeks 1-5 of the plan. </p>
        <p>For the given example, if <span class="Emphasis">include core products</span> was not selected, the contribution of core products for weeks 1-5 would be removed from the overall target values. </p>
