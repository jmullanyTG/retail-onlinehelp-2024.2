        <h1>Sales Volume % of Max Threshold calculation</h1>
        <p>For each variant and site in the sample, the total value is calculated per period (by cost or price depending on accounting method system policy value). The maximum value of the sampled periods is used as the anchor point of the calculation. </p>
        <p>The sales volume % of max threshold value is then used to validate each data point within the series. </p>
        <p>In the following, the weeks 1-7 have been set as the time frame. The sales volume % of max threshold value has been set to 15%. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The maximum value of selling periods is $1,000.00 in week 2. Therefore, the minimum sales dollars must meet or exceed $150.00 for the period to be included. </p>
        <p>Given the threshold, the sales data from week 7 is excluded for the choice count calculation. </p>
