        <h1>Attribute management</h1>
        <p>Adaptive Allocations is reliant on the existence of product attributes to make informed decisions. Therefore, basic product attributes are required with increasing capabilities based on the availability of additional attributes. </p>
        <p>Product attributes can be imported (along with their relationships to products) from an external system or created and managed within Attribute Manager if otherwise unavailable. </p>
