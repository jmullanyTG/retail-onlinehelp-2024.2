        <h1>Creating product sets</h1>
        <p>Creation of product sets is accomplished by using a filter of variants as a starting template. Product set details (variant and attribute details) can be updated by saved changes within the product set configuration.</p>
        <p>Product sets can be created and configured for consumption during the scenario plan building phase within the product set grid.</p>
        <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">New</span> on the toolbar to create new sets. </p>
        <p>All fields must be completed and changes saved before the variant detail configuration sections become available. The access level defaults to <span class="Emphasis">Public</span> unless otherwise specified. </p>
        <p>Selection sets (even linked selection sets) can be deleted for users with appropriate permissions by highlighting a row and selecting <span class="Emphasis">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>Changes made in the Variant Details sections must be saved prior to navigating away. This is represented by graying out the product set view. </p>
