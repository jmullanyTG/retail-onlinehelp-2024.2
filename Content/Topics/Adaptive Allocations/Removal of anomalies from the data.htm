        <h1>Removal of anomalies from the data</h1>
        <p>Before calculation, several steps are taken to remove anomalies from the data that could skew subsequent calculations. The most common causes of inaccuracies when using historical sales to calculate future projections via a simple average are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the item was not available for sale during part of all of the window of time.</li>
            <li> zeros may be included if averaging the entire window of time.</li>
            <li>when averaging non-zero periods only, those values may not be representative of a true average period during the window of time.</li>
            <li>the item had low stock levels impacting sales.</li>
        </ul>
