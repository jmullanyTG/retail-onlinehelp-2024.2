        <h1>Scenario Plan grid fields and descriptions</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Scenario Plan</span> grid manages the configuration of scenario plans. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Access Level</span> – Defines user access to the scenario plan. <ul><li><span class="Emphasis">Public</span> – All users within the application. </li><li><span class="Emphasis">Private</span> – Only to the creator.</li><li><span class="Emphasis">Shared</span> – Only specific users. </li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Choice Count</span> – The available choice count models. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Configuration Status</span> – The status of the scenario plan. Any missing configuration components display in a comma separated list in this field. Missing configuration elements prohibit scenario calculation. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Demand Plan</span> – The available demand plans. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Location Strategy</span> – A key component to calculation of both choice count and allocation volumes, the location strategy specifies the stores which are eligible to receive stock as part of the allocation. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Allocations/Location Strategy.htm">Location strategies</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly"> For more information on Location Strategies, refer to the Allocations User Guide.  </MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Max Pick Ratio</span> – The maximum pick quantity for the draft engine based on a percentage of the ideal pick value (calculated as need target/choice count). This field is hidden by default and defaults to system policy specified value (initializes to 200%).</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Min Pick Ratio</span> – The minimum pick quantity for the draft engine based on a percentage of the ideal pick value (calculated as need target/choice count). This field is hidden by default and defaults to system policy specified value (initializes to 50%). </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Plan Description</span> – An optional description for the scenario plan. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Plan Length</span> – The expected duration of the stock coverage from the resulting plan. Though not restricted to aligning with the selected demand plan time frame, it is considered best practice not to deviate from the already specified length of time. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Plan Name</span> – The unique name for the scenario plan. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Plan Status</span> – Defines the workflow options available for the scenario plan. Updates based on changes made to the plan. Statuses include:<ul><li><span class="Emphasis">Requires Configuration</span> – Configuration elements are missing. Refer to the <span class="Emphasis">Configuration Status</span> field for additional information. No workflow options are available until configuration is complete. </li><li><span class="Emphasis">Configuration Changed</span> – Configuration elements have changed and a plan calculation is required. Any results currently displayed within the scenario details section are related to the previous configuration and are considered to be stale. Workflow options are identical to those of the <span class="Emphasis">Ready to Calculate</span> status.</li><li><span class="Emphasis">Ready to Calculate</span> – Once configuration is complete, the plan status updates to <span class="Emphasis">Ready to Calculate</span> and the draft engine may be run. Workflow options are identical to those of the <span class="Emphasis">Configuration Changed</span> status. </li><li><span class="Emphasis">Ready to Execute</span> – Once calculation has been completed, the scenario plan results are available to view within the scenario details section and the plan status changes to <span class="Emphasis">Ready to Execute</span>. From this workflow status, users can create orders if the results are satisfactory or alter the configuration to produce different results. This updates the status to <span class="Emphasis">Ready to Calculate</span>. </li><li><span class="Emphasis">Scenario Finalized</span> – Once orders have been created, the scenario is finalized and is read-only to prevent order duplication. </li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Product Set</span> – The available product sets. Must be populated to pass configuration status requirements. </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">User Select</span> – If set to a shared access level, the list of shared users. </li>
        </ul>
