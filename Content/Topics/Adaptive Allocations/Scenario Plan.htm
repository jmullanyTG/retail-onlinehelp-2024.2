        <h1>Scenario plans</h1>
        <p>Scenario plans produce potential allocation quantities once the dependent configuration requirements have been met. Depending on the scenario outcome, the potential allocation quantities can be converted to orders.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Scenario Plan</span> screen is used to build and execute on the combined demand plans, product sets, and choice count models to generate allocation volumes to stores. Configuration occurs in the <span class="Emphasis">Scenario Plan</span> grid and results are available in the Scenario Details grid. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Like all management screens, the screen can be undocked and realigned or moved to a secondary monitor by clicking and dragging the tab to the desired location. </p>
        <h2>Creating new scenario plans</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">New</span> to create new scenario plans.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Fill in all fields before saving. </p>
                <p class="BasicNote">The default access level is <span class="Emphasis">Public</span> unless otherwise specified. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="L1indent">If any configuration details are deleted, previously executed plan results will not be altered. However, any plans which include a deleted configuration element will not recalculate (plan status updates to <span class="Emphasis">Configuration Changed</span>).</p>
