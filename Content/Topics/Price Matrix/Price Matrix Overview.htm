        <h1>Price Matrix Overview</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Price Point Matrix</span> screen displays a set of pre-approved price points across multiple currency and country combinations. The goal is to avoid very complex price conversions.</p>
        <p>The matrix takes an input value and, based on rules,  adjusts the value accordingly. If pricing for multiple stores in different currency and country combinations, the application looks across the matrix and finds the value for the currency and country combination.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">With the applicable user rights, the <span class="Emphasis">Price Point Matrix</span> screen can be used to define a default price matrix that is assigned to a new price action. The assigned default can be changed later. </p>
