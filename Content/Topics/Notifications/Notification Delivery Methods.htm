        <h1>Notification delivery methods</h1>
        <p>Users can subscribe to all or to a set of core and custom notifications, along with their defaults delivery method, for each ToolsGroup JustEnough solution.</p>
        <p>By default, the system  marks any subscribed notification with a five second visual notification. However, the delivery method can be changed using the <span class="Emphasis">User Notification Preferences</span> screen.  If subscribing to notifications at the Subscription level, the selected delivery methods default for all users. There are four types of delivery methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Hard</span>: A automatic notification for user interaction. A notification is marked as read once it has been clicked. The notification flag is not updated.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Soft</span>: A visual notification for five seconds. If dismissed, it is marked as read. The notification flag is not updated. If the notification is not acknowledged, the notification flag is updated with the most current count of unread messages. The Notification icon can be clicked later to access the notification.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Silent</span>: Notifications do not display, but the notification flag is updated with the current count of unread messages. Notifications can be viewed in the Notification inbox.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="Emphasis">Ignore</span>: The notification is dismissed and not displayed. It can be found in the notification history. The unread message count is not updated. </li>
        </ul>
