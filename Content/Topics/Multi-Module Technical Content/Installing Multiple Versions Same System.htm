        <h1>Installing multiple client versions on the same system</h1>
        <p>Users who want to compare an existing installed version of the software alongside an upgrade version can install the upgrade version without uninstalling the existing version. The Microsoft Installer (MSI) verifies down to the Cumulative Update version, so if v2021.4.3.0 is already installed, then v2023.4.0.0 can also be installed for a side by side comparison. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The MSI generates a message if users attempt to install a version that is identical to the version already installed.</p>
