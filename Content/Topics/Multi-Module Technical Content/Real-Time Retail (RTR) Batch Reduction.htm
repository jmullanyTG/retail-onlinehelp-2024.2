        <h1>Real-Time Retail (RTR) batch reduction</h1>
        <p>System policy <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> enables the generation of RTR recommended orders for the following day when the policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span> (default). By setting the policy to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span>, users also gain the flexibility to reduce their nightly batch run times.</p>
        <h3>Batch exclusion for recent recommendations</h3>
        <p>Under the default setting, if an RTR recommended order was generated within the last 18 hours, and <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> is enabled, the system skips generating new recommended orders for related items. This allows customers to avoid wasted time running unnecessary batch calculations within a short time frame.</p>
        <p>Orders generated when <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">Today</span> are NOT excluded from the nightly batch process.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of setting the system policy to the default</h3>
        <p>When the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span>, users can still take advantage of RTR instant decision making without having to wait for the nightly batch process. This reduces their dependency on the nightly batch and offers the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Faster Order Processing: Users can process tomorrow's orders today if their supply chain processes allow, facilitating quicker fulfillment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reduced Nightly Batch Needs: By generating recommended orders for the following day, users can minimize the number of nightly batch runs, optimizing system performance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Configuring the time elapsed since last calculation for batch exclusion</h3>
        <p>System policy <span class="Emphasis">Time Elapsed Since Last Calculation for Batch Exclusion</span> allows users to reconfigure the default 18-hour time limit. Users can specify the number of hours for batch exclusion, although it is not recommended to exceed 24 hours.</p>
        <h3>Job tasks</h3>
        <p>The following job tasks facilitate the recommended order generation and batch exclusion process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">(AL, RP) (Daily) Enable Batch Exclusion Process</span>
                </p>
                <p>Description: Enable the batch exclusion process to skip generating new recommended orders for items with recent recommendations.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">(AL, RP) (Daily) Disable Batch Exclusion Process</span>
                </p>
                <p>Description: Disable the batch exclusion process to allow the generation of new recommended orders for all items.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Real-Time Retail/(AL, RP) (Daily) Disable Batch Exclusion Process.PNG" class="LargeImages">

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To effectively implement the recommended order generation and batch exclusion process, the <span class="Emphasis">Enable Batch Exclusion</span> task needs to run before the Ordering Engine Executions. <span class="Emphasis">Disable Batch Exclusion</span> should run immediately after. The reason being if <span class="Emphasis">Enable Batch Exclusion</span> is left on, then orders generated by users during the day would be excluded as well.</p>
