        <h1>Working with order documents </h1>
        <p>The majority of work in Order Manager occurs in the Order Document viewing area to the right of the Navigation pane. This area is usually blank when initially accessing Order Manager. The exceptions being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> an order was opened after it was created using the <span class="Emphasis">Create Commitments</span> option in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view, or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> the user clicked a link to a specific order in the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Double-clicking an order line in the order document displays the same information found in Inventory Manager.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">User Rights control access to Order Manager and all the functionality within Order Manager.

        <h2>Viewing an order document</h2>
        <p>Double click an order document in the Navigation pane to display the order document as a separate tab. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/View Order Document.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Displaying or hiding the Column View name in a document’s caption

</h2>
        <p>A system policy labeled<span class="Emphasis"> Remove Column View Name from Document Caption</span> lets users stop the Column View name from being appended to the document name in the document’s caption. As the Column View name is important, the name is shown as a Tooltip when the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>.</p>
        <h2>Limiting the total number of columns in order documents</h2>
        <p>Order documents have a configured default column count. In addition to the default number of columns, users can add additional columns to their order documents. However, documents may become unusable if there are too many columns. To prevent this, system policy <span class="Emphasis">Column Max</span> allows for limiting the total number of columns  that can be included in an order document. </p>
        <p>For example, if <span class="Emphasis">Column Max</span> is set to 100 (the default), then users can have a maximum of 100 columns beyond the default column count.</p>
        <p>If using the <span class="Emphasis">Choose Fields</span> dialog to add columns to a document results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>in a total of 100 or fewer columns then there is no change in existing behavior and all columns display.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>in more than 100 columns then the following message is generated. (The number in the bracket is the total number of columns that can be included in the order document.)</p>

                </p>
                <p>Clicking <span class="Emphasis">OK</span> cancels the operation and no extra columns are added. Users can retry and choose fewer additional columns.</p>

        <h3>Order line</h3>
        <p class="BasicNote">To select multiple order lines, use <span class="Emphasis">CTRL + Click</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Shift + Click</span>. </p>
        <h3>Add (Not applicable to the Assortment Plan Commitment order type) </h3>
        <p>Adds order lines based on an inventory filter (Item code by site code). </p>
        <p>Order lines are returned even if they have zero orders as long as they are contained within the filter. Once order lines with zero orders are returned, then users can put in an order quantity. This can be useful if a user wants to structure the document to include what’s necessary based on the requirements of a vendor, an ERP, or a WHMS. </p>
        <h3>Copy</h3>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span> dialog allowing users to copy selected order lines to another order document in the same workflow. Only highlighted order lines are copied. Copied order lines are not deleted from the original document. Therefore, the order lines will be in the system twice. In this case, there is the possibility that both lines will be approved and transmitted. </p>
        <p>Users can create a brand new order document as the target order document using the <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span> dialog. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Copy dialog.png" class="LargeImages" />

                <p>Leave <span class="Emphasis">&lt;Create New Order&gt;</span> as the selection in the <span class="Emphasis">Copy To</span> field. The <span class="Emphasis">Add Ad Hoc Order</span> dialog displays.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Complete the fields as required.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. The new order document is added to the user’s workspace in the <span class="Emphasis">Navigation</span> pane and also displays as a separate tab.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Move</h3>
        <p>Launches the <span class="Emphasis">Move</span> dialog allowing users to move selected order lines from the current order document to another order document. This function is essentially the same as cutting and pasting the order lines. The order lines are removed from the original order document and added to another document.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Move dialog.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The workflow for creating a new order document is the same for both <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Move</span>. </p>
        <p class="Important">If a user plans on executing an order, then they should only use the <span class="Emphasis">Move</span> function. Otherwise, there is the risk of running some lines twice.</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Emphasis">Copy + Authorize</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Move + Authorize</span></p>
        <p class="p">These are single actions that accomplish repetitive actions. Highlighted selections are automatically copied or moved and then authorized. </p>
        <h3>Delete</h3>
        <p>Deletes the selected order lines. This removes the order line from the order document. However, the order line still exists in the recommendation and can be refreshed, it just is not in the context of the order document anymore. The order line can be re-added using the filter. </p>
        <p class="Important">The system does not ask for confirmation prior to deleting the order lines. However, this action can be reversed with the <span class="Emphasis">Undo</span> button.</p>
        <h3>Merge, Unmerge: (Assortment Plan Commitment order type only.) </h3>
        <p>Merges two or more order lines that share the same variant into a single line. Merged lines can be unmerged.</p>
        <h3>CheckBox Mode</h3>
        <p>Toggles between displaying or hiding a checkbox. This mode requires the user to check individual order lines. Only selected lines are actioned.</p>
        <h3>Grid right-click menu options</h3>
        <p>The grid right-click menu options include:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Export</span>: Exports grid data to a file in the selected format.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Export Options</span>: Sets text export options (Value or Display Text).</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Import Excel Data</span>: Allows users to import data directly from MS&#160;Excel spreadsheets. A confirmation dialog indicates how many rows were updated. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="Importing data.htm">Importing data from spreadsheets</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Grid fields</h2>
        <p>The columns and labels that appear depends on the order document type selected. The columns that display or can be added are a subset of all the fields available in the Inventory metadata (fields can be added or removed using the <span class="Emphasis">Choose</span> function). </p>
        <h3>Fields prefixed with user and fields prefixed with Recommended</h3>
        <p>The grid will contain two similar groups of fields: one group with a prefix of <span class="Emphasis">User</span> and one group with a prefix of <span class="Emphasis">Recommended</span>.</p>
        <p>Fields prefixed with <span class="Emphasis">Recommended</span> are system generated and read-only. Fields prefixed with <span class="Emphasis">User</span> are editable and over-write the system generated equivalent (these fields are read-only for pre-authorized and authorized order documents).</p>
        <p>For example, <span class="Emphasis">Recommended Source Site</span> and <span class="Emphasis">User Source Site</span>. The <span class="Emphasis">Recommended Source Site</span> field is populated with <span class="Emphasis">DC - US East</span>. Users can choose a different source site by entering it in the <span class="Emphasis">User Source Site</span> field.</p>
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>If constraints have been added, users can run an order constraint macro that will enforce the constraint. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Order Manager Constraint Macro.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>For example, a user’s budget is $15,000 and the sum of the <span class="Emphasis">User Order Cost Value</span> is $16,000. In this case, the user can run a pre-configured constraint macro to reduce the cost value and stay under $15,000.</p>

        <h4>Reviewing whether inventory orders meet constraints</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Constrained Status</span> metric identifies those orders that did not meet a constraint. There are three possible statuses based on applied constraints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Failure</li>
            <li>No Constraint</li>
            <li>Success</li>
        </ul>
