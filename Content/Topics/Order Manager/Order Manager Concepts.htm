        <h1>Order manager concepts</h1>
        <h2>Order documents and receipt dates</h2>
        <p>To meet the requirements of the majority of specialty retailers, there is functionality for the determination of size and prepack breakdowns for orders. Due to the inherent inaccuracies associated with doing these analyses for multiple receipt dates simultaneously, order manager documents can only be created with a single receipt date each. Unlimited order lines, including different variants and store cluster orders, can be included as long as they all share a single receipt date. </p>
        <p>This constraint also facilitates the tracking of outstanding activities for orders through the Upcoming Commitments Dashboard in Assortment Planning. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Assortment Planning/Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report.htm">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly">For more information, refer to the Assortment Planning User Guide.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2>Order workflow  </h2>
        <p>Order Manager has been integrated with the Workflow module to facilitate identification of and movement through the various stages of the ordering process, as defined by the needs of the organization. Multiple workflows, ranging from very simple expedited flows, where all stages are completed at once with a single submission of the order, to very complex, with several levels of approval at each stage and submissions to external systems after each, can be configured and used within Order Manager. The number of days out from the receipt date that each stage must be completed is configured in the Workflow module and then compared to the current date in the above referenced Upcoming Commitments Dashboard, allowing users to track their progress against established deliverables. </p>

        <p class="Important">Workflow status is set at the order line level of order documents, however, all lines in a document must have the same status to advance the document status and submit the order document to external systems. This is mainly relevant in pre-pack stage, as order lines can be selected for prepacking individually or in groups, in addition to all order lines at once</p>
        <h2>Status types in Order Manager </h2>
        <p>There are two types of status within Order Manager: document status and workflow status. </p>
        <p>Document status describes the current ownership or state of the order document as a whole. Document statuses include things like Forwarded, Authorized, and Uploaded, and cannot be changed without customization. </p>
        <p>Workflow status describes the stage of the active workflow that the order document is currently in. Workflow statuses are configurable through the Workflow module and can include anything an organization deems important. Available workflow statuses are dependent on the workflow currently assigned to an order document</p>
        <h2>Future recommended order horizons  </h2>
        <p>When generating future recommended orders, ToolsGroup JustEnough extends the horizon specified in the <span class="Emphasis">Days From Today</span> field to ensure that the order being placed has sufficient quantities to meet any inventory needs that may arise just beyond the order window provided by the user. This is especially critical for orders generated with short windows, such within 90 days.</p>
        <p>The extended order horizon is calculated automatically based on the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Future Inventory Window</span> which has a default value of 14 days. The calculation used to determine the effective horizon is (Days From Today value + supply chain lead time + Future Inventory Window value). <p>For supplier orders, the supply chain lead time is the maximum of the sum of lead times from the supplier all the way to the store. This is only done along the primary source path.</p><p class="BasicNote">This extended horizon is only used for future recommended orders for “Orders Placed”. It is not used for future recommended orders for "Orders Delivered". </p><h2>Reconsolidation orders</h2><p>A reconsolidation order is executed based on a filter of items and their associated status. After the desired inventories are filtered and selected, the quantities to reconsolidate orders are driven by the source stock selection options.</p><p>Any inventories that are resolved to be sourced from a supplier will not be returned in a reconsolidation order.</p><p>The reconsolidation order generation process requires a supply chain to determine applicable stock transfer links, as well as a supply chain to determine which statuses are valid to the run. The parameter <span class="Emphasis">@iSupplyChainIDForStatusGathering</span> will be set to the default supply chain defined using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default Supply Chain</span> (General: Planning) for all reconsolidation orders run through the UI. The parameter<span class="Emphasis"> @iSupplyChainIDForReconsolidation</span> is the specified supply chain in the <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain</span> field on the Reconsolidation Order main screen.</p><h2>Replenish Engine Runs</h2><p>Because  reconsolidation is an entirely SQL based process, there is not an individual replenish engine run executed when an order is actioned. The stock status values used are based on the most recent engine run with the system policy defined default supply chain.</p></p>
