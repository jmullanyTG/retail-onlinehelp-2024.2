        <h1>Merging Variants into a single multi-SKU prepack</h1>
        <p>Prepacks are a combination of related SKUs packaged together. In the Order Manager module, the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> view creates prepacks consisting of multiple Variants (style-color). For example, white shirts in large and black shirts in large both in the same prepack.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Rainbow Pack Calculator.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Such multi-SKU prepacks containing different style-colors (white and black shirts all at the same size) cannot be created within the Assortment Planning (AP) module as within AP everything is done at the Variant or Placeholder level. In AP, prepacks are created at the Style (6 units, all large white shirts) and Style-Color-Size (4 units, S, M, L, XL white shirts) levels. </p>
        <p>The multi-SKU prepacks in Order Manager are really combinations of Style packs created in AP. The existing Style packs are combined into larger prepacks.</p>
        <p>The multiple Variant or multi-SKU prepacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>cannot be smaller than an individual Placeholder packing instruction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>can contain multiple Placeholders, so long as the original packing multiple for each is maintained within the multi-SKU prepack. </p>
                <p>For example, a box with a maximum capacity of 20 units could hold a combination of 4 SKUs that have an order multiple of 5 each. Therefore, the value entered in the <span class="Emphasis">Max Box</span> field must be large enough to accommodate the order multiples for the selected Placeholders. </p>
                <p>Regarding excess space within a box, excess space is not filled if filling the box causes the ratio of Placeholder packs to be out of alignment. The box is not filled in order to hold the alignment among Placeholders in the pack.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>only be generated by combining the initial multiple style-color single size orders, prior to sending the orders to the ERP. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Macro <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Commitment Rainbow Packs</span> must be executed to display the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span>. The <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> is a prepack combination selection tool that uses user input parameters to search for available Variant order consolidations that would make viable multi-SKU prepacks. The parameters define the desired plan to work with, the product filter for Variants within that plan with delivery dates within the window of time, the window of time, and the maximum units or upper limit for inclusion in a box. </p>
        <p>The multi-SKU&#160;prepacks are grouped by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>identical receipt dates </p>
                <p> The Style packs created in AP cannot be edited nor the delivery dates shifted within the the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span>. Thus, for orders to be combined, they must have the same receipt date. However, receipt dates can be changed elsewhere within the Order Manager UI. The dates can also be updated by any changes being fed from the ERP. Any changes to date alignment breaks apart any multi-SKU prepacks that are no longer aligned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>common supplier </p>
                <p>A common supplier ensures that the order document and any multi-SKU prepacks are prepared for a single supplier, in case variants  are sourced by more than one supplier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> and either Placeholder Collection code or Variant Style code (controlled by system policy <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack PlaceholderCollection Grouping</span>).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">To group Variants as potential multi-SKU prepacks, the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> may have moved Commitment Variant lines from one order header to another.</p>
        <p>For selected multi-SKU prepacks which should not be created, simply uncheck the checkbox in the <span class="Emphasis">Selected</span> field in the grid. Once the desired multi-SKU prepacks have been chosen, click the <span class="Emphasis">Process Packs</span> button on the toolbar. The <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> then uses predefined packing instructions to create multi-SKU prepacks as prepacks within ToolsGroup JustEnough.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> Navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Prepack</span> tab in the Order Document to view the new multi-SKU prepack's details.</p>
        <h3>Example scenario</h3>
        <p>Two prepacks are created in AP. One for 6 large white shirts. One for 6 large black shirts. Using the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span>, orders coming from the same supplier with the same receipt dates that can be combined into 1 white/black shirt prepack can be seen.</p>
        <h2>Sorting by pack number</h2>
        <p>Drag the <span class="Emphasis">Pack #</span> column above the table to sort by pack number.</p>
