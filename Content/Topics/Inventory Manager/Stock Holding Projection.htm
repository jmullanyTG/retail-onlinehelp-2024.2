        <h1>Stock Holding Projection</h1>
        <p>Stock holding projection describes what the physical stock level will be at any point in time. The stock level only increases once the stock is received at the destination location which is why the projection is based on estimated receipt date. This is completely true for supplier orders for the first point of entry of stock into the supply chain.</p>
        <p>For DC to store or any other stock transfer within the supply chain, the first point is still valid for the destination site. However, the source location will have its SOH decreased at the sending location order date at the source by the transfer amount. </p>
        <p>There is then an inbound stock quantity for this transfer which should be a separate measure. This is typically a separate quantity as different organizations have different rules as to who owns this stock while it is in transit. Having a separate inbound stock quantity gives the flexibility to add it to the source or the destination SOH when reporting on stock holding within the supply chain.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> The ability to configure a series’ color requires user right <span class="Emphasis">Allow Stock Projection Series Configuration</span>.</p>

        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Stock Holding Projection</span> tab displays the familiar sawtooth diagram which is key throughout the inventory planning process. The colors of the various available series within the graph can be selected from a color palette.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">System policy <span class="Emphasis">Stock Projection Graph Series</span> (Module: Inventory Manager) controls which series are visible in the Stock Holding projection graph.</p>
        <p>An <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Calculate</span> button displays when the item is a Replenishment item. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This button requires User Right <span class="Emphasis">Allow Stock Projection Calculation Using Advanced Calc</span>. </p>
        <p>A status bar displays additional metadata based on the row selection or cells within a row. Certain cells within a row can be highlighted or a whole row to view the sum, average, count, minimum, and maximum values in the status bar at the bottom of the grid. To display the status bar, right-click in the grid and select the <span class="Emphasis">Status Bar</span> menu option.</p>
        <h2>Allocation versus replenishment projections</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Stock Holding Projection</span> tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related projections depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite (Replenishment, for short).</p>
        <p>If both the Allocations module and the Replenishment suite are enabled, the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy Selection</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. The <span class="Emphasis">Execution Process</span> column can be added to the Inventory Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are <span class="Emphasis">Allocations engine</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Replenishment engine</span>.</p>
