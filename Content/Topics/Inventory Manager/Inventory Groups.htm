      <h1>Inventory groups</h1>
      <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Groups</span> tab displays group settings which have been configured for the inventory. As the inventory groups themselves are highly configurable, the information displayed here varies from one implementation to another. Possibilities may include product hierarchy information, buyer groups, and so on.</p>
      <p>Classification information such as the default priority assigned and the relative deviation displays in this tab.</p>
