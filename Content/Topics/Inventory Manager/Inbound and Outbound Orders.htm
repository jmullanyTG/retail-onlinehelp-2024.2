        <h1>Inbound and outbound orders</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Inbound and Outbound Orders</span> tab displays all of the inbound and outbound orders which have been imported to ToolsGroup JustEnough from the ERP system (or other system of record). It is important to remember that this is inventory specific in that the orders displayed relate only to a single site. </p>
