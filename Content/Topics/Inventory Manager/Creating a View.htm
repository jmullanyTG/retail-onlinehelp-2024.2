        <h1>Creating a view</h1>
        <p>To reference metadata, it must either be contained in a specific view, or referenced within an existing table. An initialization procedure (INIT) should also be created to populate this newly created view. A primary key must be included within the view in order for functions within <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Common_Filter_MetaViewData</span> to work. </p>
