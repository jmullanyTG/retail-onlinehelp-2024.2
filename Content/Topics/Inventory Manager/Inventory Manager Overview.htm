        <h1>Inventory Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Inventory Manager is a powerful, yet flexible tool for monitoring and managing the inventory planning process at the inventory (item/location) level. It is a central hub of information helping to quickly drive inventory related decisions. </p>
        <p>The data displayed in reports such as the Stock Holding Projection are the results of the ordering engine run (typically a nightly task).</p>
        <h2>Filter-driven item management</h2>
        <p>Workflow processes can be streamlined  through managing by exception. By using dynamic exception filters within Inventory Manager, it is possible to quickly identify items which require attention and go to work on them immediately. Filters can be tied to a dashboard making it easier to prioritize work. </p>
        <h2>Centralized information</h2>
        <p>Inventory Manager centralizes inventory related information about items, displaying information from ERP&#160;systems as well as other modules. Available information includes (but is not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory information such as inventory ID, stock on hand, and cost price.</li>
            <li>Demand forecasts for the item (from the Forecast module).</li>
            <li>Inventory-specific inbound and outbound orders for the item.</li>
            <li>Inter-site projected demand for the item</li>
            <li>Supply information such as lead time, order multiple, min/max quantities, and alternate suppliers.</li>
            <li>Inventory policy parameters for the item (from the Policy module)</li>
            <li>Status information </li>
            <li>Stock holding projections</li>
            <li>Multi-site inventory at the item master level</li>
            <li>Financial planning information (from the Merchandise Financial Planning module)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Customizable views</h2>
        <p>Custom views can be quickly and easily created using flexible field selectors and pivoting capabilities These custom views provide the ability to focus on just the required information.</p>
        <h2>Life cycle management </h2>
        <p>Many tasks can be performed within Inventory Manager, including managing the phase-in and phase-out dates of items. The ordering engine uses these dates to optimize its recommended purchase orders at each end of an item's life cycle, calibrating order quantities accordingly. </p>
