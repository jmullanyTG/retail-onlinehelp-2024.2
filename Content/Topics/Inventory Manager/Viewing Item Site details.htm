        <h1>Viewing item/site details in the Details section</h1>
        <p>The Details section in an Inventory Manager Document view has blades (or tabs) that display information from other ToolsGroup JustEnough modules relating to the inventories returned in the filter. Each blade groups related information, some of which may be manipulated within the view. This gives users the ability to edit their inventory polices and properties at the most granular level. </p>
        <p>The item description and site information displays at the top of the Details section above the blades (see below). The items in the grid above the Details section may be viewed individually by highlighting them in the grid or using the arrow keys on the right side of the Details section. </p>
