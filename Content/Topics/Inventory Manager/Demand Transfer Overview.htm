        <h1>Demand Transfer Overview</h1>
        <p>A challenge for omni-channel retailers is ensuring that their replenishment strategies keep up with the options shoppers now have when it comes to fulfilling their purchases. These options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy Online, Pickup In Store (BOPIS)</li>
            <li>Buy Online, Ship to Home</li>
            <li>Buy In Store, Ship to Home</li>
            <li>Buy In Store, Pickup in a Different Store</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each option results in inventory potentially leaving a different site than where it was sold. When this happens, the demand for items is transferred from the sales location to the fulfillment location.</p>
        <p>If a replenishment strategy does not account for these demand transfers,  negative outcomes (such as overstocks, understocks, lost sales, and costly inventory re-orders and redistributions) can occur.</p>
        <p>To help avoid these outcomes, the demand transfer feature offers the option to choose whether items use fulfillment-driven replenishment strategies or the traditional sales-driven replenishment strategy.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Demand transfer from a DC to a store is not supported. </p>
        <h2>Sales-driven replenishment</h2>
        <p>In a traditional retail scenario, sales and fulfillment are assumed to happen at the same location. A typical example would be a customer walking into a store, taking an item off of the shelf, purchasing it at the register, and taking it with them as they walk out of the store.</p>
        <p>In such scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>demand for an item remains at its sale location.</li>
            <li>future replenishment orders for a store are based on that store's forecasted sales demand. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is sales demand?</h3>
        <p>Sales demand is a type of forecast that predicts future demand for items at a location based on historical sales at that location. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">Different types of sales demand forecasts can be created, including:</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">
            <li>inventory, level, group, and shape forecasts generated by <a href="../Inventory Forecasts/Inventory Forecasting Overview.htm">Demand Forecasting</a>.</li>
            <li>profiles generated by <a href="../Profiles/Profiles Overview.htm">Profiles</a>.</li>
            <li>rates of sale generated by <a href="../Rate of Sale Calculator/Rate of Sale Calculator Overview.htm">Rate of Sale</a>.</li>
            <li>allocations forecasts generated by <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Overview.htm">Allocation</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fulfillment-driven replenishment</h2>
        <p>In omni-channel scenarios, sales and fulfillment can happen at different locations. </p>
        <p>For example, in a BOPIS scenario, a shopper buys something online and then gets to choose the brick-and-mortar store where they will pick up their purchases.  </p>
        <p>In these scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>demand for an item is transferred from the sales location to the fulfillment location.</li>
            <li>future replenishment orders for a store should be based on that store's forecasted fulfillment demand.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is fulfillment demand?</h3>
        <p>Fulfillment demand is a type of forecast that predicts future demand for items at a location based on historic fulfillment at that location.</p>
        <p>The following fulfillment demand forecasts can be generated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.ScreenOnly">
                <MadCap:xref href="Split Factor Method Overview.htm">Split factors</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="General.PrintOnly">Split factor forecasts (for more information, refer to the Inventory Manager User Guide)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Choosing an item's replenishment strategy</h2>
        <p>By default, ToolsGroup JustEnough uses a location's projected sales demand to replenish orders at a location. Fulfillment demand can be used instead on an item-by-item basis.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">&#160;For best results, use the same replenishment strategy for all locations where an item is sold.</p>
