        <h1>Supply chain</h1>
        <p>The supply information for  specific inventory can be viewed and managed on the <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain</span> tab. Lead time, order multiple, and both minimum and maximum order quantities can be adjusted at this level if applicable. Alternate suppliers can also be added or removed within this tab.</p>
        <h2>Allocation versus replenishment information</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain</span> tab displays allocation or replenishment related information depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the Demand Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite (Replenishment, for short).</p>
        <p>If both the Allocations module and the Replenishment suite are enabled, the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy Selection</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Execution Process</span> column can be added to the Inventory Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are <span class="Emphasis">Allocations engine</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Replenishment engine</span>.</p>
