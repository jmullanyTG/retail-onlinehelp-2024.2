        <h1>Hierarchy rules</h1>
        <p>The hierarchy rule chooses the data to aggregate based on the items selected. Select the level to aggregate to (i.e. do not specify the specific class such as womens knits).  </p>
        <p>First, select the items to be allocated.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Stores are selected at the time of allocation. For example, the hierarchy rule uses the stores selected in the wizard when the allocation is actually executed.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, if there is no size component then it aggregates only to the class level and not to the class size level.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, if the rule is changed to aggregate to class and size, then the system aggregates the sales to a class (womens denim) and size (25, 26, 27, and 28).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Notice that the allocation is done per individual item and therefore the contributions of each store could be different by size.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hierarchy Rules can be used to allocate multiple sizes of products with the same rule allowing for different contributions by store.</li>
            <li>Hierarchy Rules can be used regardless of the sizes to allocate different products to stores based in the different products classes contribution.</li>
            <li>This means that only a single rule is used to allocate instead of having to create multiple fixed rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is slower than a fixed rule because the allocation has to run for every item individually.</li>
        </ul>
