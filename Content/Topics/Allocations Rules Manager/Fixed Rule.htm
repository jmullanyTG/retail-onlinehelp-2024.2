        <h1>Fixed rules</h1>
        <p>The fixed rule aggregates data across specifically selected sites (stores). In the given example stores 1001, 1003, 1005, and 1007 have been selected. Once the stores are selected, a specific class or combination of sub-classes must be selected. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Because a fixed rule is applied, the size distribution (size curve) will be applied the same way for each store. </p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The stores stock is to go to can be specified. </li>
            <li>How much each store will get based on an indexed percentage can be specified.</li>
            <li>The same size ratio can be sent out as the stock was bought in.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It can only send out in one size ratio (the same as what was bought).</li>
            <li>Only the stores that are specified in the rule can be allocated to.</li>
            <li>The exact area to be distributed to must be chosen that is if the rule is based on a knit class, all products are allocated based on the knit class sales.)</li>
        </ul>
