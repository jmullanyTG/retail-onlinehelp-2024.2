        <h1>Runtime rules</h1>
        <p>The only difference between runtime and fixed rules is there is more flexibility in sites to be allocated to. The stores are selected at the time of running the allocation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The size curve will stay the same for all sites.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can specify the stores to send the stock to. </li>
            <li>How much each store will get based on an indexed percentage can be specified.</li>
            <li>The same size ratio can be sent out as the stock was bought in.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It can only send out in one size ratio (the same as what was bought).</li>
            <li>Only the stores that are specified in the rule can be allocated to.</li>
            <li>The exact area to distribute to must be chosen. (If the rule is based on a knit class, then all products are allocated based on the knit class sales.)</li>
        </ul>
