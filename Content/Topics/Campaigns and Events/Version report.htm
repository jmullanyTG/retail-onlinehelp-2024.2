        <h1>The Version Report</h1>
        <p>The Version Report displays distribution versions for the selected Event Slot Sets. </p>
        <p>The versioning order is based on the order of the Geography Set used for the event. The first Geography in the set provides a constant for determining the Base Version for the Slot Set.&#160; Further versions are grouped by their highest ranked Geography.</p>
        <h2>Bases</h2>
        <p>Versioning is a two-step process in which the Slot Set is first broken down into color / content versions (Bases), after which each Base Version is further broken down into additional black plate / price versions.&#160; The result is a distinct set of content data by slot set and slot needed to create a complete Composition that is applicable to one or more Geographies.</p>
        <p>Base Versions are named using alpha characters beginning with the letter A. Should the number of bases exceed 26, the base name becomes a 2-character string starting with AA and continuing as AB, AC, etc.&#160; Plate / Price versions are named numerically (Preceded with the letter P) within their computed Base Version, and reset back to 1 for each base afterward.</p>
