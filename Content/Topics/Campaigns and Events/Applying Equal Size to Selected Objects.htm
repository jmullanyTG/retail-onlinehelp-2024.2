        <h1>Applying equal size to selected objects</h1>
        <p>Use the <span class="Emphasis">Equal Size</span> toolbar button to resize multiple objects so that they are of equal size in height and width. Objects cannot be smaller than 6 DIUs (about 1/32 inch) in width or height.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Objects must be adjacent to each other along the same dimension (horizontal or vertical). </li>
            <li>Multiple objects can be selected as long as each is adjacent to the original or succeeding objects. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote"> The screenshots below are from the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Price Display Format</span> window. The steps are the same for any container or slot.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Use <span class="BodyWord">CTRL&#160;+&#160;left-click</span> to select adjacent objects.</p>
