        <h1>Configuring slot sets</h1>
        <p>Slot sets display as rows in a grid. For each Slot, the attributes display as columns. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Events/Slot Set List View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Every Slot Set has a Position 0 Slot. This is where all unadvertised Promotions are located for the Slot Set. Position 0 does not have an associated Item Display Format, Space, and the Status is <span class="Emphasis">Unassigned</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Access to this screen depends on assigned rights.</p>
        <h2>Private Promotions</h2>
        <p>If a Promotion has not been shared with a user, then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the Promotion name in <span class="Emphasis">Assigned Promotion</span> displays as Private.</li>
            <li>all fields except <span class="Emphasis">Item Display Format</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Space</span> are masked.</li>
            <li>the ability to modify <span class="Emphasis">Item Display Format</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Space</span> is disabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Viewing or editing a Promotion in a Slot</h2>
        <p>Double-click on a row in the grid to display the <span class="Emphasis">View/Edit Promotion</span> screen to view or edit the details of a Promotion in a particular Slot.</p>
        <h2>Previewing a Promotion</h2>
        <p>Selecting a slot in the grid refreshes the preview pane (located to the right of the <span class="Emphasis">Promotion</span> pane).  If the Promotion has been shared with a user (the Promotion’s privacy option is Public or Shared), the read-only Promotion preview dialog displays.</p>
        <p>The Promotion preview pane is masked and displays the following graphic if a slot with an unshared Promotion is selected.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Events/Event Version Masked Promotion.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2> Selecting Geographies and available Promotions</h2>
        <p>Selecting a Slot in the grid refreshes the panes below the grid. </p>
        <h3>Geography pane</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Geography</span> pane indicates which Geographies will be automatically assigned to the Promotion when it is added to the Slot. The <span class="Emphasis">Assign</span> button is disabled for Promotions not shared with the logged-in user (the Promotion is private).</p>
        <p>For a Promotion already assigned to a Slot, it is possible remove one or more Geographies by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Assign Geography</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Events/Assign a Geography.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Geographies can be moved from the <span class="Emphasis">Included</span> pane to the <span class="Emphasis">Excluded</span> pane and vice versa. Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> when finished.</p>
        <h3>Promotion pane</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Promotion</span> pane indicates which Promotions are available to add to the Slot. A Promotion with a check mark indicates that it has been added to the Slot Set but not necessarily to the selected Slot. If a Promotion is assigned to the selected Slot, it is the only one displayed in the Promotions pane.</p>
        <p>The available Promotions pane displays Promotions with Sales Dates that overlap the Event Sale Dates. There are several buttons available above the Promotions pane:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Events/Available Promotions pane.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The available Promotions pane:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>does not display Promotions that have been designated Private.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Promotions that have not been shared with the logged-in user (the Promotion is private) do not display though they do display as Private Promotions in the Slot Set List view to denote the Slot has been populated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>displays Promotions designated as Public, shared with the logged-in user, or are Private to the logged-in user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on how system policy <span class="Emphasis">Promotion Double Click Action</span> is configured, double clicking on an assigned Promotion in the grid loads the Promotion in either a window or in the Promotions module.</p>

                        The  <span class="Emphasis">Version Prompt</span> button can be toggled on and off. When activated, a prompt requires the selection of a Geography to associate with the Promotion when <span class="Emphasis">Add to Event</span> is clicked. By selecting only a subset of Geographies for a Promotion, the excluded Geographies remain available to associate with a different Promotion and the Slot is not considered fully assigned. <span class="Emphasis">Version Prompt</span> can be disabled at any time.
