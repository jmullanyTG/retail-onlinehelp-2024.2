        <p>There are multiple rows identified with the Source Type <span class="Emphasis">System</span> that are required to ensure the desktop publishing software plugin works properly. They are displayed for informational purposes only and cannot be modified. The remaining rows can be configured for the plugin to populate desktop publishing software as needed or additional rows can be added.</p>
        <h2>Issues with versioning content ouput</h2>
        <p>If versioning is not happening for a Slot Set, the <span class="Emphasis">Non-Export Prefix</span> setting could be the source of the problem. This setting checks the Slot Set Name to see if it starts with the designated prefix, and excludes it from version calculations if it does. If Slot Sets are not getting versioned even though they should, checking this setting may reveal that this is the case because of how the Slot Set is named, or a bad prefix value for the setting. 
		</p>
        <p>If the prefix is not to be used the easiest way to ensure it will not interfere with versioning is set the value to <span class="Emphasis">Export all Slot Sets</span> (which must be manually keyed).</p>
