        <h1>Selecting Slot Sets</h1>
        <p>Selecting a Slot Set in the Navigation pane refreshes the buttons, icons and workspace area. The workspace provides the ability to modify the Slot Set's information, status and the ability to view the Slot Set as a List, visual Layout or calculated Version by Site Geography. This functionality also allows Promotions to be added or removed from the Slot Set.</p>
