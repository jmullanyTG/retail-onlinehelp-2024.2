        <h1>Content editor</h1>
        <p>For any Promotion in an Event, it is possible to modify the Content and Images associated with it using the Content Editor. Clicking <span class="Emphasis">Content</span> opens the Content Editor window for the selected Promotion.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This functionality is disabled if the Promotion was not created by or shared with the user.</p>
        <p>In the left pane of the window, every Content Version associated with the current Slot Set is displayed. Selecting a version in the left pane loads the associated <span class="Emphasis">Text</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Images</span> tabs in the right pane. Each Content Version can be unique if desired.</p>
