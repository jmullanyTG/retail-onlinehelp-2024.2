        <h1>Slot set status override</h1>
        <p>In some situations such as the need to provide additional permissions or to remove permissions, it may be necessary to change a specific Slot Set to a previous Status, different from the rest of the Event Slot Sets. Select a previous Slot Set Status by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Status Override</span>, choosing an option from the dropdown list and clicking <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Events/Slot set status override.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the modifications to the Slot Set have been completed, the Slot Set can be returned to its normal Status by selecting <span class="Emphasis">Complete &amp; Advance</span> from the Slot Set Status dropdown list and clicking <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. This pushes the Slot Set to the current Event Workflow Status.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> If the Event Status is changed before the Status Override is complete, the Slot Set inherits the new Status and the Status State is reset to <span class="Emphasis">In Progress</span>.</p>
        <p>The Event Schedule updates to reflect that the Slot Set has a Status State of <span class="Emphasis">Pending (Override)</span> for the current Status and a Status State of <span class="Emphasis">In Progress (Override)</span> for the Status that the Slot Set was reverted back to.</p>
