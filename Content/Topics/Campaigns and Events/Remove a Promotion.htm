        <h1>Remove a promotion </h1>
        <p>Removing Promotions from Slots does not delete the Promotion from the system. However, it does make the Slot, or some Geographies in the Slot, available to add a different Promotion. Promotions are removed from both the List and Layout views of a Slot Set by using the buttons near the top of the screen.</p>
