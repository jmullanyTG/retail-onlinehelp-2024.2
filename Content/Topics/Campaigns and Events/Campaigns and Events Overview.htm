        <h1>Events Overview</h1>
        <p>Event Manager supports the management of Promotions for the marketing and advertising teams. Promotions can be grouped into Events and Campaigns to track analytical goals, target  specific demographic or geographic areas, and visually build Promotions across media types. </p>
        <p>To access Event Manager, click <span class="Emphasis">Events</span> on the Influence tab.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Event Calendar</span> view displays all Campaigns and Events together in a Gantt chart. Users navigate to a specific Campaign or date to view all related Events. Color coding differentiates the various Campaigns and Event Types. Campaign color is selected during Campaign creation while Event Type dictates Event color.</p>
        <p>New Events are created using a wizard to define the Event name, associated Campaign, Event Type, Budget, and Ad and Sales Start and End Dates. Typically, each Event represents a separate channel with unique effective dates, production schedule, and budgets.</p>
        <p>After an Event is created, planners customize the Event. Users work with Slot Sets, Geographies, Site assignments and build detailed budgets. Also, vendor deals or Promotions are chosen to include in the Event. A visual representation of each Promotion provides instant feedback by displaying the Content, Pricing and any associated digital assets.</p>
        <p>Marketing budgets can be created for each Event and each production category required for the Event to be executed. Actual spend for each category is also available to support automatic rollup by Cost Type.</p>
        <p>The default targeting for each Event is predefined based on Event Type. For print Events, the segments might be geographic and for electronic Events segments might be demographic. Segments can also be mixed to allow for demographic segmentation within a geographic area. The targeting can be changed at any time allowing planners to quickly react to changing market conditions.</p>
        <p>Promotions are created and pricing and date ranges applied  using a wizard in the Promotion module.</p>
        <p>Stores and sites can be grouped together within a Promotion so they can be targeted with common promotional strategies. Multiple strategies can be set by Price Cluster within a single Promotion allowing for easy management and monitoring. In addition, the products promoted for each Price Cluster in a Promotion can be varied to account for regional availability and targeting.</p>
