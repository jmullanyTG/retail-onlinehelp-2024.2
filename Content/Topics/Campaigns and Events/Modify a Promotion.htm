        <h1>Modify a promotion</h1>
        <p>Once a Promotion has been added to a Slot, it can be modified from either the List or Layout views. To modify a Promotion in an Event, select the Promotion in the Slot Set and click on Promotion <span class="Emphasis">View</span>. This opens the Promotion Details screen in Promotion Manager. Modify the Promotion as needed and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. Navigate back to the Events solution and refresh the Slot Set to see the updates.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Depending on system policy <span class="Emphasis">Promotion Double Click Action</span>, double clicking on an assigned Promotion in the Slot Set loads the Promotion in either a window or in the Promotions module. Modifications can also be made using this method.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to modify the Event Content for a Promotion. For more information, see <a href="Content Editor.htm">Content Editor</a>.</p>
