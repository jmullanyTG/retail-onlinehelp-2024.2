        <h1>Workflow status changes</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Workflow chosen for the Event, each Event may transition through multiple statuses. An Event Schedule consists of actual dates for each Status based on the configured Workflow and the Event Ad Start Date. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">All Slot Sets inherit the Event Status. At the onset of a new Status, the Slot Sets are also assigned a Status State of <span class="Emphasis">In Progress</span> which indicates that Slot Sets are currently being worked before the current Status is marked as <span class="Emphasis">Complete</span>.</p>
