        <h1>Event compositions</h1>
        <p>The Event’s default Slot Sets are arranged in a specified order known as a Composition. The Event Type can be configured to version the Event, to contain more than one Composition, for one or more Geographies. It is also possible to have the total number of Slot Sets vary by Event Composition. </p>
        <p>Compositions allow for building alternate Slot Sets for specific Geographies using completely different layouts and product selections. The <span class="Emphasis">Event Compositions</span> view provides the ability to perform these actions.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a print advertisement where one Composition for the Eastern and Central US distribution points receives a 4-page advertisement while a second Composition for the Mountain and Western US distribution points receives a 2-page  advertisement. </p>
        <p>In addition, a third Composition is used to differentiate the Grand Opening  advertisement for a subset of Geographies separated from the original Eastern and Central Geographies.</p>
