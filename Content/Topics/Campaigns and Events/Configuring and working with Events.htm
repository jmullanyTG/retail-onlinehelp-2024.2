        <h1>Configuring and working with Events</h1>
        <p>Events display as a separate tab immediately after creation or if opened from the <span class="Emphasis">List</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Event Calendar</span> views. Depending on assigned permissions configured for the Event’s current Workflow Status, users can review or modify the Event header information, Slot Sets, Geographies, Budget and Composition.</p>

        <p>The screen consists of a navigation pane on the left and a workspace area on the right. The navigation pane displays Events and their Slot Sets in a tree style format. Selecting an Event refreshes the workspace area displaying the <span class="Emphasis">Geography</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Budget</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Workbench</span> tabs along with several buttons. </p>
        <h2>Selecting Slot Sets</h2>
        <p>Event planning activities mostly occur at the Slot Set level. Selecting a Slot Set loads a pane below the navigation tree and refreshes the workspace to provide access to the Promotion menu (View, Content) and the following: List, Layout, Versions. </p>
