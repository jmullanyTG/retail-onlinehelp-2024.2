        <h1>Schedule sets </h1>
        <p>Schedule sets are containers for schedules. The sets are applied to sites and suppliers to control order behavior. </p>
        <p>Schedules are applied to a set based on their order in the set. The application order is top-down through the set. The mode of the top-most schedule dictates the expected behavior for all other dates that are not specifically mentioned.</p>
        <p>Schedule sets are stored as almanacs in the database<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">. They can be found in the <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Common_Schedule_Almanac</span> table</MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">Schedule relationships are stored in the <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Common_Schedule_AlmanacLink</span>. table. This table also holds the behavior as ScheduleMode and the priority. For a particular schedule set (almanac), the priority 0 determines the highest priority. Its associated ScheduleMode determines the behavior of all non-specified dates. </p>
