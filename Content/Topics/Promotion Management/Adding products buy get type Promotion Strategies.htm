        <h1>Adding products to BOGO promotion strategies</h1>
        <p>Selecting a Buy Get Type strategy generates a <span class="Emphasis">Create New Promotion</span> wizard that is somewhat different to the wizard that displays when Promoted Price or Promoted Discount type strategy is selected. Products and groups are added to the Buy Group and Get Group instead of being added to the Promotion Group.</p>
        <h2>BOGO AA&#160;and BOGO&#160;AB&#160;promotions</h2>
        <h3>BOGO AA</h3>
        <p>For BOGO AA  Promotions, Buy and Get Groups are the same Group. Buy and Get groups are identical and assigned under Buy Group. </p>
        <p class="Example">Buy 1 of Item A, B, or C and Get 1 of Item A, B, or C at no extra cost.
However, if the Get group is a subset of the Buy group (only A and C are available), then this would be a BOGO AB scenario.</p>
        <h3>BOGO AB</h3>
        <p>For BOGO AB, Buy and Get Groups are different Groups. A Buy Group  contains groups of Items that must be purchased to receive whatever groups are specified under the accompanying Get Group.</p>
        <p class="Example">Buy any 2 of Items A, B, and C (under the Buy Group) and get a $5 Gift Card (under the Get Group).</p>
