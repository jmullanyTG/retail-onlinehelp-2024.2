        <h1>Adding products to Promoted price or promoted discount promotion strategies</h1>
        <p>For Promoted Price and Promoted Discount type Promotion Strategies there are three ways to add products. They are not mutually exclusive and all three methods can be used within a promotion.</p>
        <p>Once all the products have been added to the promotion, they display in a group called Item Group below the Promotion Group.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> Enter default pricing information for all products and all site clusters in the fields for Promoted Price and Promoted discount type strategies in the left pane. The information to be entered differs based on the promotion strategy selected and can be modified further at the site cluster level after the new promotion is saved.</p>
        <h2>Adding a variant</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Add Variant</span>.</li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Using a filter to add products</h2>

            <li>If required, select the checkbox <span class="Emphasis">Select only some items from the current filter</span> for individual product selection from the selected filter.</li>
            <li>Once the appropriate Filter is selected, click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. </li>
        </ol>

</li>
            <li>If required, click <span class="Emphasis">Filter</span> to change which filter is being used.</li>

            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Variant group notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the group to add is not available, first ensure the filter selected in the pop-up is for all Variants or Item Masters. If still unavailable, navigate to Content Manager to create the group required for the promotion.</li>
            <li>These groups are dynamic meaning the associated products included in the group are automatically updated depending on the filter criteria used to create the group. This update only occurs as long as the promotion is in an unlocked state.</li>
            <li>When adding a group to a promotion, a copy of the original group is automatically created, including the filter criteria used to define the group. Changes can be made at the promotion level without affecting the originating product group.</li>
        </ul>
