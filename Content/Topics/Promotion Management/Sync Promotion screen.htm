        <h1>Syncing promotions</h1>
        <p>Demand forecasting accuracy can be improved by defining a planned lift factor by cluster set and having those values pushed to the Causals import API. This is achieved by selecting the button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sync</span> located on the toolbar. Selecting this button displays the <span class="Emphasis">Sync Promotion</span> dialog in which the override lift value as a percentage can be entered. </p>
        <p>Right-click in the <span class="Emphasis">Override Lift</span> column and choose the option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> to update multiple rows simultaneously.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The user right <span class="Emphasis">Allow access to Sync</span> (Right Group: Promotions)  is required to access this functionality.</p>
