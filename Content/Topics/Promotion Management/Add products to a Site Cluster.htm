        <h1>Add products to a site cluster</h1>
        <p>Products can be added to each of the Promotion’s Site Clusters. The manner in which products are added differs depending on the type of strategy specified.</p>
        <h2>Buy one get one (BOGO) promotion strategies</h2>
        <p>For BOGO&#160;promotion strategies, see <MadCap:xref href="Adding products buy get type Promotion Strategies.htm">Buy one get one (BOGO) promotion strategies</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Promoted price or promoted discount type promotion strategies</h2>
        <p>There are three ways to add products for Promoted Price and Promoted Discount type Promotion Strategies. The three ways are not mutually exclusive and all three can be used within a Promotion.</p>
        <h2>Adding a variant</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Add Variant</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Add Variants</span> dialog, enter a product code (for Variant or Item Master, depending on the global policy) in the <span class="Emphasis">Products</span> field or select the <span class="Emphasis">Add Variants From Clipboard</span> button.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Variant codes can be copied using the right-click menu option <span class="Emphasis">Copy Column Cell(s)</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Using a filter to add products</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Select to Add</span>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> dialog, click the dropdown arrow in the <span class="Emphasis">Filter</span> field and select a filter.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">If an appropriate filter does not exist click, click on the black hammer icon to create a new filter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>If required, select the checkbox <span class="Emphasis">Select only some items from the current filter</span> for individual product selection from the selected filter.</li>
            <li>Once the appropriate Filter is selected, click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Adding a variant group</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
				Click <span class="Emphasis">Add Variant Group</span>.
			</li>
            <li>If required, click <span class="Emphasis">Filter</span> to change which filter is being used.</li>
            <li>In&#160;the <span class="Emphasis">Select Variant Groups to Add</span> dialog, select the checkbox for each group to be added to the Promotion. </li>
            <li>Click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>If the group to add is not available, first ensure the filter selected in the pop-up is for all Variants or Item Masters. If still unavailable, navigate to Content Manager to create the group required for the promotion.</li>
            <li>These groups are dynamic meaning the associated products included in the group are automatically updated depending on the filter criteria used to create the group. This update only occurs as long as the promotion is in an unlocked state.</li>
            <li>When adding a group to a promotion, a copy of the original group is automatically created, including the filter criteria used to define the group. Changes can be made at the promotion level without affecting the originating product group.</li>
        </ul>
