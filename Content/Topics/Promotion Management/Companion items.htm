        <h1>Companion items</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Companion Items</span> tab provides the ability to promote products that are not included in the Promotion. Some examples of Companion Items are batteries for promoted electronic devices, extended warranties, cell phone cases and car chargers. Companion Item associations are independent of Site Cluster definitions.</p>
