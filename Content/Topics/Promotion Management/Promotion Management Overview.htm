        <h1>Promotion Overview</h1>

        <h2>Promotion Management</h2>
        <p>By managing all types of promotions across all channels in a centralized system, companies now have the capability to coordinate promotions across all departments that are involved in the process from merchandising to marketing and advertising.</p>
        <p>Users can group stores and sites together within a promotion so they can be targeted with common pricing strategies. Multiple promotion  strategies can be set by Site Cluster within a single promotion  to allow for easy management and monitoring. In addition, the products promoted for each Site Cluster in a promotion  can be varied to account for regional availability and targeting.</p>
        <p>There are times when external factors that are not captured in the system affect the performance of a promotion. For these times, or for new products that are unique, planners can override the system generated forecast. Users can configure which factors can be overridden and by whom. Additionally, all financial calculations use the override values.</p>
        <p>While planning a new promotion, it is vital to understand how and when the current product was promoted previously, and what the results were. The current promotion can be compared side-by-side   with past promotions to identify any potential problem areas or areas of opportunity.</p>
        <p>During the planning process, users can evaluate multiple scenarios to identify which variables will provide the desired results. Users can change the promotion  strategy, customer segmentation, price, promotional channel, vendor funding and many other configurable variables. The system then re-forecasts based on the new information. In addition, the boundaries that the forecasting engine uses can be constrained based on user preference within the approved corporate margin.</p>
        <p>When evaluating the effectiveness of a promotion it is vital to understand how it impacted the overall product category. Without this information, there may be a false reading on how well promotional efforts are contributing to the bottom line. Users can identify the impact each promotional offer had on the overall category to avoid cannibalization of other key products.</p>
