      <h1>Calculations examples</h1>
      <p>Best practices require that fields that have no value (null fields) are not permitted to cause an error in the system while calculations are being performed. </p>
      <p>In the examples in the links below, the ISNULL() function is used frequently. This function replaces a null value with 0 thus ensuring that best practices are followed. </p>
      <p>In some cases, the ISNULL() function is used to determine if a price override has been keyed at a lower level. The price override would then be used in the calculation, rather than the Promotion level keyed data.</p>
      <p class="BasicNote"> The calculations may vary from these examples due to implementation requirements.</p>
