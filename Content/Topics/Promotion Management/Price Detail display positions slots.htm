        <h1>Price detail – display positions (slots)</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Price Detail – Display Positions (Slots)</span> tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Price Details</span> tab is used to assign Promotions directly into an open Slot in an Event Slot Set. Ensure the <span class="Emphasis">Parameters</span> button is enabled. To load all available Slots, select <span class="Emphasis">All</span> from the <span class="Emphasis">Available Events View Option</span> dropdown menu and click <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span>.</p>
        <p>Event Slots that do not display signifies that either a different Promotion has been placed the Slot or the user does not have access to the Space that the Slot is in. A Slot can be displayed across more than one row if the Promotion in the Slot is not associated with all Geographies in the Event.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Available Events View Option</span> dropdown list determines which accessible Slots from overlapping Events display in the grid. Select one of the options below and click <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span> to alter the Slots displayed in the grid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">All</span> – Show Slots that are available or assigned to the current Promotion.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Available</span> – Show Slots that do not have Promotions assigned to all Event Geographies.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Assigned</span> – Show Slots that the current Promotion has been assigned to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The grid displays a row for every Slot contained in an Event that has overlapping Sale Dates and some Sites in common with the current Promotion.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A check mark in the <span class="Emphasis">Assigned</span> column signifies that the current Promotion has already been placed in that Slot. </p>
        <p>Rows that are formatted red are read only meaning that the user can't change that Promotion in the event for that row.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Assigning Promotions to available Event Slots</h2>
        <p>To assign the Promotion to an available Event Slot, select the <span class="Emphasis">Assigned</span> column in the applicable row in the grid, click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> and click <span class="Emphasis">Ok</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Event Slot Links</span> dialog. </p>
        <p>Once a Promotion has been assigned to a Slot, the pane on the right displays all Products and Product Groups associated with the Promotion.  </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Price Detail display positions Featured.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Featured</span> checkbox beside one Product (Item or Group) applies the selected Product’s Master Content and the Pricing to the Event’s Slot. </p>
        <p>Click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> above the right pane to apply the Content and Pricing selections to the Event Slot. The ability to push a specific Product’s Content and pricing is not available for BOGO AB type Promotions.</p>
