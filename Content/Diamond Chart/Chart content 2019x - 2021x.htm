        <h2>User Interface</h2>
        <h3><a name="2021.4SHELL"></a>2021.4</h3>
        <h4>Displaying metadata for a column</h4>
        <p>For any screens that have the <span class="Emphasis">Choose</span> button, there is now an option on the popup menu called <span class="Emphasis">Column MetaData</span>. Selecting <span class="Emphasis">Column MetaData</span> displays a popup tooltip with any metadata for the column.</p>
        <p>The tooltip is activated when hovering the mouse over the column name. If:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
no information is on the filter metadata tables for the column nothing is shown. </li>
            <li>
the column is a calculated column the popup will show the expression using the friendly name of the columns involved.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">The existing metadata tool has been updated to allow users to populate their own metadata description and Override fields.

        <h4>Menu reorganization </h4>
        <p>For v2019.1, the navigation menus have been reorganized to be more intuitive and easy to use. The new groupings below the top level menu items better associate modules within the suite for a more consistent user experience.</p>

        <h4>Fill Column right-click menu option </h4>
        <p>A new right-click menu option labeled Fill Column has been added to data grids. The new option allows users to select a value in a grid and populate all fields in the column with that value, only those fields above the value, or only those below the value. The option is available in grids where there are not dependent fields that need to be cross-filled and it is only enabled where it can be used. The following rules always apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The grid must be editable and not be read-only.</li>
            <li>The focused column must be editable and not be read-only.</li>
            <li>The selected cell must be editable.</li>
            <li>The row must be a valid data row.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Color configuration option in graphs </h4>
        <p>Within Inventory Manager, individual users can now configure the color palette within the graphs on the Stock Holding Projection tab and the Forecast Viewer tab. This new functionality allows users to select a color palette which is most visually appealing and accessible for them. Select the new user rights below to enable this functionality.</p>

        <h4>JSON Export configuration enhancements</h4>
        <p>Users now have the ability to dynamically configure their standard export types and order document exports in the <span class="Emphasis">Views</span> module. This new functionality creates flexibility for users in the order export process.</p>
        <p>Two Maintenance views have been created to support these additional configurations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Standard Export Type Configuration</span>
                </p>
                <p>Users can expand the <span class="Emphasis">Payload Type</span> dropdown and select either XML or JSON as the payload type.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Although the JSON payload type can be seen in the dropdown for other export types, this functionality is currently only available for “Order” export types.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Inventory Order Document Export Configuration</span>
                </p>
                <p>When in this view, users can easily select which columns they would like to include in the inventory order document. Users can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>use the <span class="Emphasis">Output Name</span> field to configure the field name if needed.</li>
                    <li>bring in the <span class="Emphasis">Order Document Section Type ID</span> column to identify which section of their order document the metadata is taken from.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>filter for specific metadata, whether that is inventory metadata or order header / order line metadata.</p>
                        <p>Everything defined in filter metadata is selectable for inventories. This means that the metadata will dynamically read off whatever is configured within the system.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In most, if not all cases, users can configure the necessary metadata, fields, and column information needed to export their order document.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.4API"></a>2020.4</h3>
        <h4>Variant Pricing import by site</h4>
        <p>New imports now support Variant-Site Pricing.</p>

</h4>
        <p>A new sales type labeled <span class="BodyWord">COVID-19 Modeled</span> stores procedurally generated sales data to cover gaps created during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sales data helps maintain seasonal curves or any reactive forecasting mechanisms. The new sales type lets users easily differentiate between regular actual sales and the procedurally generated sales.

        <p class="BasicNote">The  new sales type is located within a Sales Type Group labeled <span class="BodyWord">Disaster Model</span>.</p>
        <h4>Marking certain products as essential</h4>
        <p>As of v2020.3, Inventory Planners can now mark certain products as essential. A new filter metadata labeled <span class="BodyWord">Essential</span>  allows certain products to be marked as essential so that these products can be filtered for exception management. The <span class="BodyWord">Essential</span> filter can help drive inventory policy tasks such as increasing the Safety Stock days at DC type sites.</p>
        <p>The new filter can be selected when creating or updating Inventory, ItemMaster, Variant, and VariantSite filters. It is selectable and displays in <span class="BodyWord">Inventory Manager</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Variant Site Manager</span> as a read only field. It is selectable, viewable, and editable in <span class="BodyWord">Variant Manager</span>.</p>

        <h4>assortment.Target schema</h4>
        <p>All objects in the assortment.Target schema are abandoned.  The whole sub-module has been moved to the rationalize Target namespace.  Any custom objects or data need to be migrated as well.  All standard data and objects are migrated as part of the upgrade script.</p>
        <h3>Sales Plan view</h3>
        <p>AUT is now editable directly in Sales Plan View.  The separate AUT widget is deprecated (that is it will not ship in standard 2021.4, and it will no longer be supported by R&amp;D as of this version of the application).</p>
        <p>The Sales Plan View has been converted to an SQL Server pivot widget. Any saved layouts or customizations from the previous SPV widget will be lost. Unfortunately, there is no way to save or transfer saved layouts or customizations from one widget type to another. Any layouts will need to be recreated and re-saved as needed. Any customizations will need be reimplemented on the new widget.</p>
        <p>The former Sales Plan View (created with Pivot widget type) is no longer supported.</p>

        <p class="Important">The following two Promotions related breaking changes must be addressed prior to the upgrade script being run. Failure to do so may result in script errors.</p>
        <h4>Formula verification implemented for calculation formulas (SQL)</h4>
        <p>Formula verification will require that any existing Promotion Calculation / Validation formulas identify column names within square brackets.</p>
        <p>For example: PromotionPrice needs to be changed to [PromotionPrice].  Failing to do so may result in the formula being invalidated.</p>
        <h4>Aggregate-style formula verification enabled </h4>
        <p>Table: dbo.tbl_Promotion_Common_PriceAggregationTypes, AggregationTypeID rows 2 (“No Aggregation”) and 6 (“Min no 0”) have been <span class="Emphasis">removed</span>.  Adjust any Promotion Price Calculations using these to NULL.</p>
        <p>Promotion Price Calculation validations have been strengthened:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a Method is provided, an <i>optional</i> Aggregation Field may be provided, but no Aggregation Type may be associated with the Calculation.</li>
            <li>When a Formula is provided, an Aggregation Type may only be stated when the Level is one of “Aggregate”, “Group” or “Variant”.</li>
            <li>When a Formula is provided and <ins>no</ins> Aggregation Type is stated, the Aggregation Field must be empty, too.</li>

        <h4>Product Group</h4>
        <p>usp_Allocate_ProductGroup_VariantEligibility_FilterToStrategy_Select signature has changed to no longer use Filter ID but Product Group ID instead. Therefore any cusp call to it or the procedures that reference it (usp_Allocate_ProductGroup_VariantEligibility_Select &amp;  usp_Allocate_ProductGroup_VariantEligibilityBreakdown_Select) will need to be revised. </p>

                <p>Procedure usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_SiteDefault_Calculate_Advanced is deprecated and no longer in use. All Functionality is consolidated into usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_SiteDefault_Calculate.</p>
                <p>Procedure usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_SiteDefault_Calculate method signature has changed. More Parameter inputs have been added which affects any cusp override implementation (cusp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_SiteDefault_Calculate)</p>
                <p>Deprecated use of usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_Calculate_Helper and usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_Calculate_Helper_Advanced which have been superseded by usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_Calculate_History_SalesHistoryByType, usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_Calculate_Future_Forecast.sql and usp_Allocate_ProductModel_Contribution_Calculate_Future_FinancialPlan. In addition these new procedures have a reduced parameter input contract.</p>
                <p>Extensibility model for StrategyMetricTypeID has been changed to configuration based. Added Extensibility Model to based on configured values mapped to StrategyMetricTypeID in tbl_Allocate_Strategy_MetricType. All configured stored-procedures defined must have the following parameter contract:</p>
                <p>@iUserID INT</p>
                <p>,@iAllocateProductModelID INT</p>
                <p>,@iVariantHierarchyID INT</p>
                <p>,@bActiveItemsOnly BIT</p>
                <p>,@bUseAdvanced BIT</p>
                <p>,@vResultTable NVARCHAR(128)</p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Channels</h4>
        <p>With the introduction of Channels, it is imperative clients update their Strategy Process if they do not use omni channel strategy lines.</p>
        <h4>Coordinating channel relationships through the engine</h4>
        <p>The module does not coordinate channel relationships through the engine. It is imperative that this is resolved with the CLIENT’S PROCESS.</p>
        <p>For example, Strategy One - Retail, Strategy Two - Outlet has shared DCs and/or SDCs. The last strategy to run the engine will remove any OVERLAP inventory from the related strategies. So if Retail ran first and had 200 units on order for a related DC, but then Outlet ran second it would remove the 200 units from that related DC which can cause the entire order for Retail to not be realistic.</p>
        <p>The client’s process must be that they run their highest priority channel first through the engine, then set them to a state that sets Pending Stock (i.e. pre-authorized). Then they can run the next priority channel, then set the Order Manager State. This process will be repeated until their channel priority list is exhausted.</p>
        <h4>Update to the RPV base widget type</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view has been converted to an SQL Server pivot widget. Any saved layouts or customizations from the previous <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view widget will be lost. Unfortunately, there is no way to save or transfer saved layouts or customizations from one widget type to another. Any layouts will need to be recreated and re-saved as needed. Any customizations will need be reimplemented on the new widget.</p>
        <p>The prior widget type (if the widget conversion is not applied) will no longer be supported, as the new widget type is standard moving forward.</p>
        <h4>Replenish Engine </h4>
        <p>The new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Replenish Engine - Supplier Orders - Number of Late Days Allowed</span> defaults to 0, which means you need to set it to the correct value in order to consider Supplier Orders.</p>
        <h4>Site Import</h4>
        <p>Columns FullAddress nvarchar(256) and PostalCode nvarchar(20) added to tables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>dbo.tbl_API_Import_Site</li>
            <li>dbo.tbl_API_Import_Site_Archive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The new columns will be processed by Procedures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>usp_API_Import_Site</li>
            <li>usp_API_Import_Site_Post</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these columns are included in the import payload, usp_API_Import_Site_Post will insert or update table core.Site_TerraLocation.</p>
        <h3><a name="2021.2BC"></a>2021.2</h3>
        <h4>Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>Previously, when using Target Creation, if you specified <span class="Emphasis">End Date Definition</span> as Markdown, then the last period in the selected window of time WAS the markdown date.  So the planned values in the grid represented totals for the window of time, EXCEPT the last period. </p>
        <p>Now, the last period chosen in the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> field reflects the last regular period. Upon Smart Start, new items will be created with Markdown Date as the next period (for example, if <span class="Emphasis">wk21 - wk39</span> is chosen, <span class="Emphasis">wk21</span> is Phase In, and <span class="Emphasis">wk40</span> is Markdown). The phrasing of the choice in the <span class="Emphasis">End Date Definition</span> specification will be modified to be more clear.</p>
        <h4>Improved performance of Stock On Hand actualization</h4>
        <p>The parameter <span class="Emphasis">@iBatchRunID</span> has been added to the procedure <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Maintenance_Actualize</span>. Any customizations to this procedure should be updated.</p>
        <h4>Filtering</h4>
        <h4>Optional stored procedure to Initialize default ItemMaster And Site Item Assign Filers</h4>
        <p>Breaking change in terms of behavior. Historically we applied intersection of active inventory filter items with inventory filter under consideration. We now apply intersection of inventory filter under consideration with (Inventory Filter Item Assign, Site Filter Item Assign and ItemMaster Filter Item Assign [Intersection of Inventory Filter, Item Filter, Site Filter]) to resolve the items under consideration. This implies that Site and ItemMaster Item Assign Filters must be configured for users that use inventory filter from now on.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The new procedure, <span class="Emphasis">usp_INIT_URRM_AssignDefaultItemMasterAndSiteItemAssignFiltersForUsers</span>, should not be run automatically and should only be called under upgrade scenarios where these values were not defined before.</p>
        <h4>Import/Export SQL</h4>
        <p>When calendar data is imported, the PeriodName, ParentPeriodName, and LastYearParentPeriod fields are now capped to 20 characters from the previous 128 (the destination columns for this import remain at 20 characters in length). The import will truncate any string longer than 20 characters before it lands in the import table.</p>
        <h4>Order Manager</h4>
        <h4>Macros running automatically on creation of Commitment orders</h4>
        <p>The order in which processes run has been refined.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">assortment.Commitment_Generate_Post</span> has been created and replaces <span class="Emphasis">assortment_C.Commitment_Generate_Post</span> within <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Commitment_Generate</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">assortment_C.Commitment_Generate_Post</span> is called at the beginning of <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Commitment_Generate_Post</span> as a cusp.

</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">assortment.Commitment_Generate_Post</span> handles the following UI elements:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>UI refresh of Assortment Planning Lines
</li>
            <li>the UI refresh of the Order Manager list
</li>
            <li>the process that opens the created Order Manager documents.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2020.4BC"></a>2020.4</h3>
        <h4>Allocation</h4>
        <p>Updated cusp,pre,post method calls to be complete with signature of usp_Allocate_Engine_AssignPrepacks. This is a breaking change for cusp implementations.</p>
        <h4>Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>The internal procedures <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Placeholder_Instance_DefaultConstraints_Update</span> and <span class="Emphasis">assortment.LineViz_PlaceholderInstance_Index_Find</span> now have new parameters. Any customizations of these procedures will need to be updated to accommodate them.</p>
        <p>The input <span class="Emphasis">@iLinkingID</span> was switched to <span class="Emphasis">@vLinkingIDs</span> in the procedure. Any customization needs to be updated.</p>
        <p>If <b>Receipt AUC</b> is missing for some receipt periods, the value will not be auto-filled with the weighted average value (e.g. the value shown in main planning view or Cluster Sets View). The value will be blank and require the user to fill it.</p>
        <h4>Price Manager</h4>
        <p>The Pricemanager.Calculation VariantSite procedure was modified to consolidate parameters for custom calculation methods. Existing custom calculation procedures that do not match the following parameters may not function correctly and will need to be updated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>@iUserID int
</li>
            <li>@iPriceActionID int
</li>
            <li>@Method nvarchar(261)
</li>
            <li>@VariableID_Output int
</li>
            <li>@Debug tinyint</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2020.3BC"></a>2020.3</h3>
        <h4>API </h4>
        <p>Optional parameters have been removed. The parameters were not used. Any custom logic that used the parameters will now break.</p>
        <h4>Assortment Planning </h4>
        <h4>Calculations that roll up time-series AUC to lifetime have been modified </h4>
        <p>While not a breaking change it is important to note that the metric <span class="BodyWord">AUC</span> that appears in the above reports now represents Receipt AUC. Nothing is "breaking," as in, no errors will be thrown, but the meaning of the field has changed.</p>
        <p>The following have changed to account for the new method of calculating AUC:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rollup Report
</li>
            <li>Reconciliation Report
</li>
            <li>Upcoming Commitments Report
</li>
            <li>Choice Count Reports
</li>
            <li>Sales Plan View</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Updating of renamed field required </h4>
        <p>The column "ExpiredPeriodLastEOP" has been renamed to "ExpiredPeriodLastEOPUnits". Therefore, any custom code referencing this field must be updated.</p>
        <h4>Product selection on Filters instead of Product Hierarchy </h4>
        <p>Parameter for the report is switching from product hierarchy (@vProductLevelIDs) to product filter (@iProductFilterID). Any customizations of this report will need to be updated or the report will fail to load with an error.</p>
        <h4>Replenish Engine </h4>
        <p>If not using our intelligent, by Policy, mechanism, table maintenance will wastefully copy purely current data, purging no aged-off data, which can consume SLA window time unnecessarily when the truncate option is exercised.  Replace any ad-hoc TRUNCATE of any replenish schema table at the start of a Daily or Weekly run with a call to replenish.BulkReplenishment_TruncateByPolicy.  Use the Policy Maintenance UI functionality to modify the defaulted ‘No Truncation’ policies, ‘Truncate replenishment Projection data for bulk batch executions' and/or 'Truncate replenishment Order data for bulk batch executions".</p>
        <h4>MFP Hybrid Cost</h4>
        <h4>Target Stock to Plan metrics </h4>
        <p>Previously, when Target Stock to Plan metrics were manipulated at the aggregate monthly level, the stock levels needed for the entire month were updated in week 1. As of v2020.3, this is no longer the case and there is no option to maintain that functionality.</p>
        <p>The new functionality results in the aggregate Target Stock to Plan metrics being applied across all weeks within the month which provides a better starting point for weekly plans stock levels.</p>
        <p>This change applies to all three Target Stock to X metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target Stock to Sales</li>
            <li>Target Stock Units to Sales Units</li>
            <li>Target Stock Cost to COGS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2020.14"></a>2020.1</h3>
        <h4><a name="Assortme"></a>Assortment Planning </h4>
        <p> For Placeholders with a defined markdown date, a regular ROS is calculated for the period from the phase-in date to the beginning of the markdown period. A markdown ROS is calculated for the period from the start of the markdown to the phase-out date.  </p>
        <p>Previously,  if the markdown date was extended, then both the regular ROS for the new extended regular period and the markdown ROS&#160;for the new markdown period were recalculated. Importantly, the new regular ROS and markdown ROS were lower than before the markdown extension. These new lower rates of sale were backdated changing the sales plan for the defined period. </p>
        <p>This changing of the regular ROS and the markdown ROS after the extension of a markdown date has been eliminated for v2020.1.</p>
        <p>Now,  if the markdown date is extended, then both the original regular ROS and original markdown ROS hold and apply to the new  extended regular period and the new markdown period. Whatever the regular ROS&#160;was by week by number of weeks is applied to the new weeks that used to be markdown and are now regular.</p>

        <h4>Compute Manager </h4>
        <p>The startup to the Compute Manager Service needed to be changed. With the .NET Core 3.1 upgrade, Microsoft deprecated the --server.urls argument and instead replaced it with --urls. The PowerShell script that is part of the MSI installer has this reflected change, but any installation that does not use the MSI will need to rerun the PowerShell script to update the command to start up the Compute Manager Service. </p>
        <h4>Forecasts </h4>
        <p>Due to database changes in  v2020.1, all forecast calculations need to be redone.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.32"></a>2019.3</h3>
        <h4>Changes to the way markdowns are treated in Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>The way markdowns are treated in Assortment Planning is fundamentally different now. It used to be just a date - nothing in the sales plan or receipt plan would change in response to setting a markdown.</p>
        <p>Old functionality</p>
        <ul>
            <li>assume you have a 10 week plan, with 100 sales, and a flat seasonality curve. The sales curve generated would then be: 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10.</li>
            <li>If you added a markdown date of Week 6, the sales plan would stay identical. If you added the markdown at Week 8, the sales plan would be identical.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As of ToolsGroup JustEnough v2019.3:</p>
        <p>New functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have no markdown date, the sales curve is the same as before: 10 units per week across the 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>If you add a markdown date at Week 6, then the sales curve trends to 0 starting from week 6. The sales plan would be: 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 8 / 6 / 4 / 2, for a total sales value of 80.</li>
            <li>If you add a markdown date at Week 8, then the sales plan would be: 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 6.7 / 3.3, for a total sales value of 90.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, because the Markdown Date now influences the generated sales plan (which, in turn, influences the generated receipt plan), then all the other existing ways to change a sales plan now interact with this new feature. Changing phase dates affects the sales plan - the way in which it affects the sales plan depends on whether a markdown dates is set, and where in the plan it is set. Changing total sales will split proportionately across the pre-markdown and post-markdown halves of the sales plan. Adding and removing a markdown date will change your sales total. Adding a markdown date to a new placeholder before adding a sales total will behave differently than adding a sales total before adding a markdown date.</p>
        <h4>The system no longer taking the markdown portion of a plan into account </h4>
        <p>Historically, the system took the demand from the markdown portion of a plan into account and recommended a total matching the Sales plan which not is desired from a stock holding position. As of v2019.3, when the new system policy labeled <b>Allow Receipts After Markdown</b> (Maintain &gt; Policies &gt; Engine: Commitments) is set to <b>False</b> (default), the Receipt plan only considers the regular portion of the Sales plan and ignores the markdown phase of the plan. Set the system policy to <b>True</b> if additional stock should be ordered beyond the planned markdown date.</p>
        <h4>Revisions to the Sell Through metric</h4>
        <p>The metric, Sell Through, was user-editable and changes affect the metric Additional Buy. The Sell Through metric is now read-only. Additionally, Sell Through used to represent the ratio between total sales and total buy. Now this metric represents total sales/total orders.</p>
        <h4>On Order now included in all EOP/BOP&#160;values</h4>
        <p>Previously, On Order (the sum of Committed, On Order, and On Order (Unknown) was not included in Reconcile and Rollup reports. As of v2019.3, On Order is included in all EOP/BOP values. Therefore, customers who customized the formula to include On Order should verify that On Order is not double counted.</p>
        <h4>Financial Planning </h4>
        <p>New parameters have been added to the following procedures, either as input parameters to the procedures, or the procedure calls a procedure with a new parameter. This means any CUSPs for the following procedures need to be updated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Maintenance_Hybrid - calls procs with new parameters</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Maintenance_Hybrid_OnOrder - new parameter, calls proc with new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Calculate_OnOrder - new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Maintenance_Hybrid_Forecast - new parameter, calls proc with new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Calculate_Forecast - new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Maintenance_Hybrid_Sales - calls proc with new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Calculate_SalesHistory - new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Maintenance_Hybrid_Inventory - calls proc with new parameter</li>
            <li>dbo.usp_FinancialPlan_Calculate_BOP_EOP_Inventory - new parameter</li>

        <h4>Shell</h4>
        <p>The default mode for the navigation ribbon is now the new slim mode. This is a potential breaking change for any UI automated tests. It is suggested to utilize the existing "fat" ribbon for the default value for the automated test user account.</p>

        <h4>Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>On Order is now cached and updated asynchronously. Note the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customization referencing any of the following changed objects needs to be updated to reflect the new paradigm:<ul><li>assortment.Engine_ReadXML</li><li>assortment.LineViz_Placeholder_Select</li><li>assortment.LineViz_PlaceholderCollection_Select</li><li>assortment.LineViz_PlaceholderInstance_EOPBOP_Calculate</li><li>assortment.LineViz_View_Cluster_Select</li><li>assortment.Maintenance_Actualize</li><li>assortment.Maintenance_SalesPlan_Recalculate</li><li>assortment.Maintenance_StockOnHand_Actualize</li><li>assortment.ReceiptPlan_UpdatePost</li><li>assortment.Report_BuySheet_Select</li><li>assortment.Report_Rollup_Select</li><li>assortment.SalesReceiptPlan_Select</li></ul></li>
            <li>The procedure assortment.SplitOutstandingQuantity_Update is deprecated; all references in customization should be removed.</li>
            <li>Customization inserting, updating, or deleting on tbl_SupplierOrderLine, tbl_SupplierOrderLineVariant, and orderamanger.Order_Line_Commitment_Variant needs to be updated to call the pubsub.Publish procedure, examples of which can be found in<ul><li>assortment.Commitment_Generate</li><li>dbo.usp_API_Import_SupplierOrder_Line_Variant_Post</li><li>dbo.usp_API_Import_SupplierOrder_Line_Post_ByPartition</li></ul></li>
            <li>The receipts line shown in Receipt Plan used to be inclusive of order information, but now it is additive.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Merchandise Financial Planning
</h4>
        <p>There is a new parameter in the CUSP hooks called <span class="BodyWord">Currency Neutralization</span>. Any customized stored procedures
for InitialSelect will need to be modified to be functional.</p>
        <h4>Price Manager</h4>
        <p>A new nightly job labeled <span class="BodyWord">Pricing Plan and Action Cleanup</span> cleans up historical Pricing Plans and Actions to maintain database growth. This new nightly job needs to be configured to the customer data retention policies.</p>

        <p>For 2019.1 onwards, the menus have been reorganized for a consistent user experience.</p>
        <h4>Assortment</h4>
        <p>Sites that are specifically excluded within Assortment planning now remain so. This is based on a new system</p>

        <h4>Recommendation to create new User ID to run the nightly Workflow
Heartbeat job</h4>
        <p>Prior to 2019.1, the trigger method "Auto Advance Node Status by Completion Days Out for Workflow Triggers"
used the User ID that last modified the promotion or price when determining whether to automatically advance a
status to the next status. The user’s permissions and ability to modify promotions were modified as a result of the
status being advanced.</p>
        <p>As of 2019.1, the system now uses the specific User ID that is attached to the Workflow Heartbeat. By default, this User ID is set to 1 (IOAdmin). To avoid unintentionally changing permissions on IOAdmin, it is recommended that a separate User ID be created and attached to the Workflow Heartbeat.</p>

                        This policy determines what mechanism is used to match a markdown curve to a sales plan.  The two options are: Period Match - this will search for the markdown week within the markdown curve (on any year, LY, LLY, a future year, etc, depending on the configurations of the time periods of the curve and sales plan).  Then it will match up subsequent periods one by one, looping the curve around as many times as necessary as to cover the whole markdown plan.  A value of Scale To Fit will align the first period of the curve with the first period of the markdown plan.  If the sizes of the curve and plan are different, the curve will either be compressed or elongated to match the size of the sales plan.

        <h4>Shell </h4>
        <p>If a user encounters a Shell error while logging into the application UI, this may be an issue where the configuration file is not up-to-date with the software version that is being run. The user will need to check for the following to make sure there are no issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The most up-to-date version of the UIL has been installed</li>
            <li>Referenced version files located in the shell.config file have been updated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Event Version SnapShot Report is not supported by the REST API middle tier for this version</h4>
        <p>While most of the <span class="BodyWord">Events</span> module works with the REST services, the <span class="BodyWord">Event Version SnapShot Report</span> within the Events module is not supported by the REST API middle tier for this version. </p>
        <p>Clients using the Events module in 2020.3 who want to use the <span class="BodyWord">Event Version SnapShot Report</span> will need to use the existing SOAP services as there is no way to run the <span class="BodyWord">Events</span> module in REST and the <span class="BodyWord">Event Version SnapShot Report</span> report in SOAP. Therefore, customers wishing to use the REST services in Events will not be able to use the <span class="BodyWord">Event Version SnapShot Report</span> report.</p>

        <h2>Assortment Planning</h2>
        <h3><a name="2021.4AP"></a>2021.4</h3>
        <h4>Creating target scenarios </h4>
        <p>Target Creation is a powerful tool within the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span> module. While Target Creation remains an important part of the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span> module, v2021.4 introduces the Target Creation functionality as a stand-alone module labeled <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Counts</span>. While this capability is included within the standard Assortment Planning module, Target Choice Count can now be licensed separately. This gives customers the ability to take advantage of intelligent recommendations when creating assortments even if they do not use the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span> module.</p>
        <p>For more information, see the <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span> section.</p>
        <h4>Improved hierarchy integration with MFP</h4>
        <p>AP may be planned at a lower hierarchy than the related MFP plan. Under prior functionality, the MFP plan would be split evenly by the number of sub-hierarchy items. Improved functionality uses LY hierarchy contributions as a basis for splitting the MFP plan, rather than an even split. This split behavior is consistent with the current cluster set/cluster split behavior.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing choice counts per target segment</h4>
        <p>A new worksheet labeled <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> is included in the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span> module and in the new <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Counts</span> module. This new worksheet displays as a tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> view and is comprised of a pivot grid displaying Placeholder level guidance for Sales and ROS within scenarios.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Target Choice Count Target New Choices screen.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>This grid shows projected Sales, Sales Units, ROS, and ROS Units of the TY Act New metrics as defined in the Target Worksheet.  It shows how TY Act New Sales and Sales Units are broken out across each of the recommended placeholders in TY Act New Choices.  If the scenario is Smart Started, these are the placeholders that will be created, and these are how the initial sales plans will be seeded.  In the above, the segment <span class="Emphasis">Bags (W)</span> is shown; the first two visible choices will be assorted to three Clusters in three Cluster Sets for a total of nine assortments</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the Calculate and Rationalize processes</h4>
        <p>The Calculate and Rationalize processes can take some time to complete. Rather than have users wait for these processes to complete, these processes are now submitted to the Workload Queue. Users are now notified when these processes are queued and completed. In:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target Choice Count (TCC) mode, the Notification only contains the name of the Scenario and the hyperlink opens the Target Choice Count module. </li>
            <li>
			AP/TCC mode, the Notification contains both the Assortment Plan name and the name of the Scenario and the hyperlink opens the AP module.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information on Notifications, refer to the Notifications User Guide.</p>
        <h4>Target Worksheet enhancements</h4>
        <h4>Including Supersession and Disaster Modeling types in split sales</h4>
        <p>The following metrics have been added to the Target Worksheet. In the below definitions, “Other” refers to sales types that are NOT a part of the standard sales types of Regular, Supersession Regular, Markdown, Supersession Markdown, Promotion, or Supersession Promotion.  This means that disaster-modeled sales types are included in the “Other” bucket, as well as any custom sales types.”</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Cost Type for Supplier Variant Cost</span> must be defined with the Cost Type associated with the supplier variant cost.</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the user experience</h4>
        <p>The following changes have been undertaken to improve the user experience of the Assortment Planning module:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the toolbar functionality of the supporting views has been expanded to include a <span class="Emphasis">Maximize</span> button and the layout has been revised. When a view is maximized the <span class="Emphasis">Maximize</span> button changes to a <span class="Emphasis">Restore</span> button.</p>
                <p>When docked, the new layout is <span class="Emphasis">Close</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Maximize</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Home</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Dock</span></p>
                <p>When undocked, the layout is <span class="Emphasis">Close</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Home</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Maximize</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>attribute descriptions have been added beside the Attribute Value Code within the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight</span> view.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2021.3AP"></a>2021.3</h3>
        <h4>Comparing values of default versus manual calculated receipt plans</h4>
        <p>A new report labeled <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Constraint Comparison Report</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Dashboard</span> view in AP. This new report displays actual receipt constraint values with cells formatted in orange if their values differ from the default, cluster default, attribute default, or item cube default by Placeholder. The report lets you quickly identify where the parameters that were used to generate a receipt plan varied from defaults that were setup.  </p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Though defaults can be defined in AP, users have the ability to override those defaults. You can use the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Constraint Comparison Report</span> to identify where the defaults were overridden.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing assortments by site</h4>
        <p>A new report labeled <span class="Emphasis">Assortment By Site Report</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Dashboard</span> view. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Assignment By Site Report.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>This new report lets you quickly review information by site, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cluster Set / Cluster membership</li>
            <li>Site status</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of sales plan</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of receipt plan</li>
            <li>Approximated proportion of EOP units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The right hand section displays the split of sales plan by site with the data being for each Placeholder, as well as aggregates. This section shows: <span class="Emphasis">Selling Period</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Sales Units Share</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units Share</span>, <span class="Emphasis">EOP Units Share</span>, and the <span class="Emphasis">Contribution Percent</span> used to derive the shared units values. </p>
        <h4>Defining curves for markdown periods in Sales Plans</h4>
        <p>Within the Assortment Planning module, multiple curves can be selected to calculate a Sales Plan. These  curves trend toward zero when a markdown is later added to a Placeholder or Variant. Users can now specify an individual markdown curve that can be applied separately after the markdown date. Markdown curves can be selected via a new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Markdown Curve</span> that has been added to the main planning view and the Cluster Sets view.</p>
        <p> Whether <span class="Emphasis">Period Match</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Scale To Fit</span> is the mechanism used to match the markdown curve to the sales plan is determined by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Algorithm To Match Markdown Curve to Sales Plan</span>. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Though not required, it is recommended to choose a curve that trends downward over time.</p>
        <p>A new system policy, <span class="Emphasis">Markdown Curve Default Behavior</span>, controls what happens to a markdown sales plan if no markdown curve is selected.  Depending on how <span class="Emphasis">Markdown Curve Default Behavior</span> is configured, either a line trending to zero will be used to decrease the sales plan to zero at phase out or the sales plan does not slope to zero and the markdown sales plan is left unchanged.</p>
        <p>For more information on the two new system policies, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing Actual First Sale by period</h4>
        <p>A new metric been added to the main planning view and the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view. This new metric lets you review the Actual First Sale by period. The new metric is:</p>

        <h4>Defining the Receipt AUC metric when adding new Placeholders</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUC</span> metric is now editable (though not required) when adding new Placeholders via the <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholders</span> screen and new rows on the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen.</p>
        <h4>Setting the maximum number of receipt periods for Placeholders</h4>
        <p>In the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view, you can now set the maximum number of receipt periods for placeholders using a new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span>. This is useful in scenarios where only a specific number of deliveries of a Placeholder or Variant is desired. For example, if only 2 deliveries are wanted (i.e. the initial delivery and then the balance received in 1 subsequent flow), then <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span> would be set to 2.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Default values can be set at the product hierarchy level.</p>
        <h4>Functionality notes</h4>
        <p>Existing receipt period eligibility continues to function as designed, and could result in more than the specified value in <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span>.</p>
        <p>Default hierarchy receipt period Flow and No Flow designations take priority over the defined maximum number of periods.</p>
        <p>Periods expressly defined as a receipt period within the default hierarchy are still eligible as receipt periods regardless of the defined number of maximum receipt periods at the Placeholder level. Also, receipt periods can still be selected or deselected within the Receipt Plan view.</p>
        <h4>Calculations</h4>
        <p>When calculating or recalculating receipts, the <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span> metric is considered and the engine suggests the defined number of receipt periods.</p>
        <p>The receipt flow eligibility metrics (<span class="Emphasis">Flow Period Frequency</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span>) are considered by the engine when you click <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span>. 	The flows are recalculated, and any user-opted-in and user-opted-out flow periods remain as selected or deselected.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">A value of zero in <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span> causes this constraint to be ignored. Zero does not result in generating zero receipts. </p>
        <h4>Revised formatting</h4>
        <p>To reflect that there can be more receipt periods than the default, the formatting for the Receipt Period metric in the Receipt Plan view has been revised as follows:</p>

        <h4>Reviewing receipt penetration</h4>
        <p>Two new read-only informational metrics have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view to provide visibility to receipt penetration distribution. The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Cumulative % of Total System Receipt Units</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Cumulative % of Total Receipt Units</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These new metrics can be used in conjunction with the new <span class="Emphasis">Max # Rcpt Pds</span> metric described above.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Any desired changes to receipt quantities must be done through existing means (e.g. min pres, min stock to sales, user override receipts)</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the AUT and Receipt AUC import process</h4>
        <p>Functionality to import AUT and Receipt AUC  into AP was added in v2020.4. Two system policies determine the means by which the AUT and Receipt AUC values are set. This functionality has been enhanced. </p>
        <h4>Preserving user-entered values</h4>
        <p>Regarding scenarios where system policies <span class="Emphasis">Editability of AUT</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Editability of Receipt AUC</span> are set to 3 (AUT is managed through both imports and the UI, with a "last in wins" principle).</p>
        <p>Previously, imported values automatically replaced values input by users. Now, data will only be imported if the Last Modified Date on the variant cost/price data is later that the date logged against the Placeholder. </p>
        <p class="Example">If an import sets AUT to 12, and then the user changes the value to 13, the next run will not reset the value back to 12. If price data is updated via imports to 14, then the next maintenance window will set AUT to 14.</p>
        <p>Additionally, periods will only have an imported AUT or Receipt AUC value set if that value actually exists in price/cost data. Unlike in previous functionality, it will not set all missing periods to zero.</p>
        <h4>Automatically importing and assigning Variants from MS Excel spreadsheets or from the Clipboard</h4>
        <p>The process of importing and assigning Variants from MS Excel spreadsheets or from the Clipboard has now been automated. This new functionality significantly reduces the time and repetitive work required to make Variant information (descriptions, color, vendor style code, costs, etc) from Vendors available in AP.</p>
        <p>To import, click the new button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Assign</span> on the toolbar of the main planning view and select one of the options on the dropdown. The option <span class="Emphasis">Unassign Selected</span> has been moved from under <span class="Emphasis">Undo</span> to the <span class="Emphasis">Assign</span> sub-menu.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The import functionality functions in the same way as the <span class="Emphasis">Import Excel Data</span> menu option in Order Manager.</p>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Variants and PLM Codes to be assigned must exist in the Style Bank.</li>
            <li> The Placeholders being assigned must be eligible for Variant and PLM Code assignment (i.e. Active and not Locked, not in Status <span class="Emphasis">Allocation</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Committed</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span> and not actualized).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is possible to reassign Placeholders from one PLM&#160;code to another as long as the Placeholder is not committed or actualized.</p>
        <h3><a name="2021.2AP"></a>2021.2</h3>
        <h4>Setting flow period frequency based on Item Cube (ROS &amp; Cube size)</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Cube Matrix</span> view lets you define and update the Flow Period Frequency based on the intersecting ranges of Placeholder/variant ROS and Cube Size (which references a volumetric attribute).</p>
        <p>The attribute to reference is defined using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Attribute to reference when applying item cube</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Flow Period Frequency is the default number of periods between receipt dates calculated by the receipt planning engine.</p>
        <p>Navigate to the Views module to access the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Cube Matrix</span> view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Views/Assortment Cube Matrix.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h5>Specifying which hierarchy levels will use item cube logic</h5>
        <p>A new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use Cube for Flow Period Frequency?</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab. This field lets you specify which hierarchy levels will use item cube logic.</p>
        <h4>Selecting aggregate size curves in Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>A new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Use Size Curve By Site</span> controls whether Assortment Planning uses the by-site curves or aggregate curve.  This is utilized in three places:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Size Break calculations in AP orders in Order Manager</li>
            <li>In Pack Type calculations</li>
            <li>In supersessions, if only some of the inventories for an existing Variant are mapped to inventories for a new Variant, and the supersession quantities need to be split by percentage</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Defining a default delivery day of the week</h4>
        <p>Previously, when you committed an order, the order start date corresponded to the period start date (for example, if the period starts on a Monday then commitment orders are always received on Mondays). As of v2021.2, you can specify days of the week other than the period start by using offset days. Using offset days affects the date on the order within Order Manager.</p>
        <p>You define the offset at the Product Hierarchy level by entering a value in a new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Period Delivery Date Days Offset</span>  on the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab. Therefore, if your period begins on a Monday then entering a value of 1 offsets delivery days to Tuesday.</p>
        <h4>Excluding sites by country on a Placeholder level</h4>
        <p>The Manage Location functionality as it relates to Country has been enhanced. If Country has not been defined in your hierarchy, you can now filter or exclude products or sites that sell in a particular currency or country using new Country related metrics added to the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Locations</span> screen. These new metrics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Country</li>
            <li>Country Code</li>
            <li>Currency Code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, more Placeholders can now be edited simultaneously and optimization work has reduced the time taken to load data into the UI.</p>
        <h4>Viewing snapshots outside of the selected window of time</h4>
        <p>The list of snapshots displayed in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Snapshot Date</span> parameter is normally restricted by the dates selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter. For example, if you select a small window of time then the list is restricted by the start and end dates selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Window of Time</span> parameter.</p>
        <p>To see all available snapshots for the plan including those outside the selected Window of Time, system policy <span class="Emphasis">Return all Cluster Set Snapshot Dates</span> should be set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>.</p>
        <h4>ROS calculations updated to use Active site count versus Total site count </h4>
        <p>For v2021.2, ROS calculations have been updated to use Active site count rather than Total site count. The following metrics were updated to use Site Count (Active):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approx ROS ($) and (U)</li>
            <li>Reg ROS ($) and (U)</li>
            <li>Mkdn ROS ($) and (U)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The metric <span class="Emphasis">Reg Ftr Active Site Count</span> is now used for the calculation of Ftr ROS ($) and (U).</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Reg Ftr Active Site Count</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> supporting view to provide visibility to the actual site count. </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Reg Ftr Site Count</span> is also in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> supporting view to provide visibility to the total site count. </p>
        <h4>Reviewing override values using the Sell Through % metric </h4>
        <p>The Sell Through % metric is a display metric only and does not affect any calculations. Previously, this metric displayed system generated values only. This resulted in user overrides being ignored. To reflect the fact that user overrides are becoming more common and to provide greater clarity, the Sell Through % metric has been updated to display override values where available.</p>
        <p>The Sell Through % metric has been updated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>S/T % and Reg S/T % in the main planning view for both Placeholders and Collections and  in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> supporting view. </p>
                <p class="BasicNote"><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span> and <span class="Emphasis">S/T % Delta</span> are unchanged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>S/T % in the Receipt Constraints supporting view.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote"><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span> is unchanged.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A metric called Sellthrough in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view, the Rollup report, and in the MFP module is NOT the same metric as described above. Sellthrough is reverse stock to sales (Sales / BOP), is something different than Sell Through %, and is unchanged.</p>
        <h4>Distinguishing different metrics in the Assortment Rollup report</h4>
        <p>The standard cell formatting used throughout Assortment Planning and Merchandise Financial Planning has been extended to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Rollup</span> report. This improves the readability of the report.</p>
        <h4>Displaying only relevant variants applicable to a selected placeholder</h4>
        <p>The usability of the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view has been enhanced for v2021.2. By default, the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view displays all variants regardless if they are within the selected product hierarchy. This can lead to a very large list to look through to find a desired style. </p>
        <p>If selected, a new View Option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Style Bank</span> evaluates the contents of the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> based on the currently selected row in the main planning view. This new option provides a much smaller relevant list of styles that would make sense to be applied to the selected placeholder. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If the View Option <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Style Bank</span> has been selected, then the <span class="Emphasis">PLM Code</span> field acts as a dropdown and shows the same Variants as the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view. Alternatively, you can double-click a selection within the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view.</p>
        <h4>Selecting values in the Attributes view</h4>
        <p>To enhance the user experience, the values that display in the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view now display in alphabetical order.</p>
        <h4>Viewing effective forecast units in the Receipt Plan view</h4>
        <p>A new metric has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan</span> section of the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. The new metric, <span class="Emphasis">Effective Forecast Units</span>, allows you to view the effective forecast units for weekly period/bucket types for future periods only. </p>
        <p>To utilize this data, a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Show Effective Forecast Units in Receipt Plan View</span> must be set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span> to display unit values other than 0. </p>
        <h4>Enhancement to the Min Stock to Sales metric</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Min Stock to Sales</span> metric has been enhanced to allow two decimal places. Previously, users were required to enter only round numbers. This metric is found in the following views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assortment Plan Defaults</li>
            <li>Assortment Plan Defaults By Cluster</li>
            <li>Receipt Plan</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Generating Commitments for multiple Placeholders within the Receipt Plan view</h4>
        <p>The functionality of the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view has been enhanced to allow for creating Commitments once you have completed editing the constraints for multiple Placeholders. Previously, while you could edit the constraints for multiple Placeholders, to create Commitments you then needed to select individual Placeholders one at a time in the main planning view.</p>
        <h4>Recalculating receipts for multiple Placeholders with a Receipt Status of Dirty</h4>
        <p>As of v2021.2, you can recalculate receipts for multiple Placeholders with a Receipt Status of Dirty by selecting them in the main planning view and  clicking <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. The Receipt Status for the selected Placeholders updates to Clean.</p>
        <h4>Defining and reviewing Phase In and Actual First Sale by date</h4>
        <p>Existing functionality allows users to define and edit Phase In by weekly periods. Two new metrics have been added to the main planning view and the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view. These metrics let users define and edit Phase In and review Actual First Sale by date (for example, 6/9/2021). The two new metrics are:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../Resources/TableStyles/standard.css');" class="TableStyle-standard" cellspacing="0">

            <col class="TableStyle-standard-Column-Column2" />
            <thead>
                <tr class="TableStyle-standard-Head-Header1">

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4>Reviewing sales history by site count

		</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sales History Site Count</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view. This metric displays how many stores had sales of a Variant in each period. This metric only displays values for past periods with sales. Future periods display zeroes as long as they are not actualized. As periods actualize, the actualized periods update to reflect the number of sites with sales greater than zero.

		</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Sales History Site Count</span> metric depends on the value set in existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Assortment days history to actualize</span>. If the number of days to actualize does not reach as far back as the Phase In date, then a Sales History Site Count may not be displayed for those periods between Phase In and the first actualized date.</p>
        <h4>Configuring Item Master Group values with Clusters</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> view allows for the configuration of Item Master Group X values with Clusters. Each segment is assigned cluster sets.  Comparison data is aggregated for all clusters found within those cluster sets (based on the snapshots specified for use in the scenario by the <span class="Emphasis">Use Comparison Cluster Set Snapshots for Comparison Data</span> system policy).
		</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> view is used in Target Creation in the Assortment Planning module and requires that system policy <span class="Emphasis">Target Filter Item Master Group</span> be set to a particular Item Master Group. </p>
        <p>The variants used to aggregate history is based on either the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Target Filter, or </li>
            <li>the hierarchy level (if Segment by Hierarchy was used to create the segment). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By configuring Item Master Group X values with Clusters, the list of variants is further narrowed down by cluster, depending on the definitions set in system policy <span class="Emphasis">Target Filter Item Master Group</span> (e.g. Cluster A will only use variants with Item Master X property of “1”).

		</p>

        <h4>Selecting and applying LifeCycle Curves</h4>
        <p>The new Lifecycle Curve allows two sets of logic to apply to a sales plan simultaneously.  In the existing Seasonality Curve concept, a curve can be chosen to generate a sales plan that reflects the expected seasonal influences over time, like coats peaking in winter.</p>
        <p>For long-selling items, the Seasonality Curve will allow for the same seasonal effects to repeat over the years.  The addition of the Lifecycle curve allows for the expected trends over the life of the item to also be taken into account - for example, the item selling strongly at the beginning of its life, and tapering down over time.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The Lifecycle Curve can be set for placeholders in the new field Lifecycle Curve in the Placeholders and Collections views, and they can be set for specific cluster set / clusters in the Cluster Sets view.</p>
        <h5>Weighting the Curves</h5>
        <p>There is a weighting of the Seasonality Curve and the Life Cycle Curve. This weighting takes into account the fact that a product has a certain life cycle with a particular Curve but you are now using a non-comparable period. You may want X% of the Curve based on the Seasonality Curve and Y% based on the Life Cycle Curve. Once you have determined the percentages you add the value to a new field, <span class="Emphasis">Seasonality Curve Factor</span>.</p>
        <h5>Seasonality Curve Factor </h5>
        <p>When an Item has both a Seasonality Curve and a Life Cycle Curve, the Seasonality Curve Factor determines how the two curves influence the Sales Plan. A value of .5 means that the two curves each influence the Sales Plan 50% each. A value of .7 would mean that the Seasonality Curve is weighted at 70% and the Life Cycle Curve at 30%. The values for the two curves always add up to 100%. </p>
        <p>The Seasonality Curve Factor is only relevant if there is both a Seasonality Curve and a Life Cycle Curve. If only one curve is set, then any value in the <span class="Emphasis">Seasonality Curve Factor</span> field has no effect.</p>
        <h5>Site Counts</h5>
        <p>The number of sites across the life span of the non-comparable period can be taken into consideration. For example, the initial life cycle may only have had 4 sites but the new life cycle has 6 sites. As a result, Sales need to respond to the difference in Site Count and accommodate for the additional sales at the additional sites.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Whether or not site counts are included in adjusting Sales Plans is controlled by existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Toggle on/off snapshot aware seasonal index calculation</span>. If set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, site counts by period will be included in adjusting Sales Plans and, therefore, the Sales Plan.</p>
        <p>Site Counts is not new functionality in v2021.1, but it is noted here as functionality relevant to crafting an ideal weighted curve.</p>
        <h4>Identifying what is changing Sales Plans</h4>
        <p>The following fields have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">SEASONALITY</span>&#160;section of the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> supporting view to help users identify what is influencing a Sales Plan:</p>

        <h4>Matching Sales Plans with Life Cycle and Seasonality Curves</h4>
        <p>Where the periods between a Sales Plan and a Life Cycle or Seasonality Curve do not exactly match, you can configure the system to match up the periods of the Sales Plan with the periods of the Life Cycle and the Seasonality Curve. Two new system policies allow you to stretch or shrink Curves to match Sales Plans.</p>

        <h4>Accounting for new store openings through the life of items  

		</h4>
        <p>New functionality and two new metrics have been added to account for new store openings through the life of items.  This new functionality increases the safety stock (Minimum Presentation or Minimum Display) at particular points during the life of the item by front loading or ordering more stock earlier to account for new store openings.  The increase in safety stock occurs at each flow date, instead of at the beginning of the life of the item.  Additionally, instead of applying a multiplier for all sites, a new metric will only apply a multiplier for the count of new sites.

		</p>
        <p class="Important">To function as designed and apply the multiplier for the count of new sites only, it is crucial that the <span class="Emphasis">Date Opened</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Date Closed</span> fields be accurate within Site Manager.</p>
        <p>The two new metrics are:
		</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">New Site Min Pres Multiplier</span>: This value is applied against the minimum presentation for only site counts with new store openings.
			</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">New Site Multiplier Number of Periods</span>: Applies only to the site count of new store openings.
			</li>

        <h4> Setting attribute properties for Variant and VariantPlaceholder entity types</h4>
        <p>A new view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Defaults</span> has been added to the Views module. This new view lets you define: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Lead Time Days</span> (in days). Provides an updated Order By Date for all orders, not only the first. This is for reference only and does not actually move the order date.</p>
                <p>The currently defined lead time displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Default Lead Days</span> field in the Assortment Planning main planning view. Once an additional lead time is set, the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard Report</span> shows an updated Order Date, Due Date, and Is Past Due? date. The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view displays an updated Order By Date.</p>
                <p>The system first looks for an attribute-set default lead time, then a hierarchy set lead time, then the system policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Periods before Phase In</span> (by periods). For the first order only, affects the first delivery and moves the order date forward in the receipt plan. </p>
                <p>Periods Before Phase In is editable within the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan Constraints</span> section within the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view,<span class="Emphasis"> Assortment Plan Defaults By Cluster</span> view, and <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> view.</p>
                <p>The last-in value between a user override from the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan Constraints</span> section and  a user change in the Attribute Default view takes priority. The new attribute default will only show the updated Periods Before Phase In value after receipt recalculation, and only updates placeholders that have not phased in yet.</p>
                <p>The system first looks for an attribute-set default (Variant), then an attribute-set default (Placeholder), then a hierarchy cluster default, then a hierarchy default, and then the system policy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both <span class="Emphasis">Lead Time Days</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Periods before Phase In</span> can be set at both the Variant and VariantPlaceholder levels. This allows the same attribute to have different times assigned depending if a Placeholder is in Placeholder status or Variant status.

			If the same lead time is desired for both, then you should define against both entity types in the dropdown in the <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Defaults</span> view.

            <li>Buy Commitment Allocate Units</li>
            <li>Buy Commitment Replenish Units</li>
            <li>Buy Commitment Supplier Order Units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The metrics provide visibility to receipt commitments driven by allocation or replenishment variants and are useful in conjunction with an Open-to-Buy tool. This gives greater visibility to receipt dollars being spent, for both AP and allocation and replenishment variants within a period.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The three fields display for today’s period and future periods, are hidden by default, and are read-only. </p>
        <h5>Reviewing (sales) demand in the period when that demand is projected</h5>
        <p class="p">Two new metrics within the Sales Plan supporting view provide visibility to demand in the period when that demand is projected. The two new metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Projected Sales Units</li>
            <li>Projected Sales Units (Comparison)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Improved Choice Count aggregation</h4>
        <p>In Target Creation, the columns for Choices, Choices Maximum, and Choices Minimum in each column group set (Comparison, Comparison Regular, Comparison Promo, etc)  have been reduced to one Choices column. This Choices column has improved aggregation.</p>
        <h4>Supersessions in AP: Using an existing variant's EOP as the BOP for a subsequent variant</h4>
        <p> v2021.1 introduces existing Supersession functionality into AP. Supersessions let users forecast demand for new items with no sales history by using an existing variant's EOP as the BOP for the new item. </p>
        <p>Supersession relationships are defined in the Supersession module at the Item Master level (style-color-size) and best practice is to map all sizes to create a 1-to-1 relationship. For multi-size variants, Supersessions are defined by size, for each size. New Supersessions defined in the Supersession module and changes to existing Supersessions are automatically pushed into AP.</p>
        <p>Typically, outside of the new Supersession functionality AP is at the Variant level (style-color) and does not consider size. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Supersession functionality in AP is enabled by setting new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Enable Supersessions</span> to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h5>Example scenario</h5>
        <p>There are times when a new variant is close enough to an existing variant that the two variants are seen by customers as interchangeable. (For example, Variant A = red socks with black squares, Variant B = red socks with black circles.)</p>
        <p>In such a scenario, the stock on-hand position of the first can be considered when planning stock needs for the second variant. This is very useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>both items look very similar</li>
            <li>
                <p>Variant B’s lifecycle is after Variant A’s lifecycle and the user would like to use Variant A’s EOP as Variant B’s BOP</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">Phase dates need to be considered when utilizing supersessions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>the supplier of an existing variant produces the same style each year, but changes the style-code/SKU in subsequent years</li>
            <li>when stock from one item should be considered towards stock for a subsequent item.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Viewing Supersession details</h5>
        <p>Within AP, two new metrics provide information at the placeholder level:</p>

        <h4>Specifying user-friendly descriptions for placeholders and collections </h4>
        <p>Two new system policies allow for the specification of custom user-friendly descriptions for placeholders and collections generated from the Seed process. A style description or variant description is still respectively appended at the end of the custom description as an indicator to the seed link (for example, ‘custom text from system policy’ + style or variant description). The two new system policies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Description for Generated Placeholder Collections from Seed</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Description for Generated Placeholders from Seed</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Imported AUC and AUT values</h4>
        <p>Two new fields labeled <span class="BodyWord">Import AUC&#160;Price Type</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Import AUT Price Type</span> allow users to use or override imported AUC and AUT values. These two new fields have been added to the existing Variant Site Cost and Price data feeds. </p>
        <p>The fields are governed by two new system policies. The two new system policies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Editability  of Receipt AUC</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Editability of AUT</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">If either system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">2</span> (AUT or AUC is only managed through imports), then the metric is read-only for Placeholders with a status of Assigned, Committed, Replen, or Allocate. For placeholders with a status of Open and Created, the&#160;metric is editable. </p>
        <p>For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Setting new placeholders as active or inactive</h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <span class="BodyWord">Active</span> has been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen. This new column allows users to specify if new placeholders are active or inactive when created. If the field is checked, then the placeholder is active when created and can be added to existing promotions. If unchecked (the new placeholder will be inactive), then the <span class="BodyWord">Add to Promos?</span> field is deselected and not editable. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sales plans created from mapped variants persist.</p>
        <h4>Requiring placeholders be reviewed before commitments are generated</h4>
        <p>As of v2020.4, users can be required to review placeholders before commitments are generated. A new field labeled <span class="BodyWord">Reviewed?</span> has been added to the main planning view (MPV) and the Cluster Set view indicating if placeholders have been reviewed. </p>
        <p>If the field is checked, then all underlying Cluster Sets have been reviewed. Unchecked indicates that none have been reviewed and multi-select indicates a mix of reviewed and non-reviewed at the Cluster Set level.</p>
        <p>To edit in the MPV, users require the User Right <span class="BodyWord">Allow the ability to mark Placeholder as Reviewed</span>. The field is always read-only in the Cluster Set view.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This field is visible only when new system policy <span class="BodyWord">Require Placeholder Review before Commitment Generation</span> is set to True.</p>
        <h4>Specifying whether particular Receipt periods will or will not be flow dates</h4>
        <p>A new view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Manage Receipt Periods</span> is now available by clicking the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Periods</span> button on the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> view toolbar. The <span class="Emphasis">Manage Receipt Periods</span> view provides detailed visibility to how receipts are planned and a way to effectively manage Receipts at an aggregated hierarchy level with Receipt periods assigned to specific weeks. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Periods screen.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The default setting is determined by the new system policy <span class="BodyWord">Default Flow Date Type</span>.</p>
        <p>Receipt periods can be assigned at any level of the Product hierarchy and can be assigned to all underlying levels. Exceptions can be made on underlying levels in the hierarchy. Only those time periods selected using the <span class="BodyWord">Window of Time</span> parameter populate the grid.</p>
        <p>The Receipt periods are applied to all existing Placeholders whose phase dates intersect with the selected time periods, and the defaults will be applied to all new Placeholders created in the future.</p>
        <p>Users can apply all Receipt Period defaults to all existing items by clicking one of the two buttons on the top of the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Receipt Periods</span> view.</p>
        <p>If there are placeholders that are assigned to a parent hierarchy level but haven’t been assigned a final product level, then all placeholders assigned at that parent level are affected. For example, placeholders assigned to <span class="Emphasis">Mens &gt; Accessories</span> that have not been given a more specific assignment (Bags, Belts, etc) will be affected if the <span class="Emphasis">Mens &gt; Accessories</span> level is on the screen.</p>
        <p>The date selection parameter determines which Placeholders are affected in terms of how their Phase dates overlap.  If any point of the life cycle of the Placeholder intersects the selected Window of Time, then all flow dates for the planned life of that Placeholder are updated, not just the periods being selected.</p>
        <h4>Modifying receipt planning constraints for multiple Placeholders</h4>
        <p>You can select multiple Placeholders in the main planning view and modify their receipt planning constraints in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. However, if multiple Placeholders are selected, then the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Receipt Plan</span> section in the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view is greyed out. After editing multiple Placeholders, you must then select them one at a time to recalculate receipts, create commitments, and restore default constraints.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Receipt Plan Greyed Out.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h4>Creating Commitments in bulk</h4>
        <p>A new button on the toolbar in both Placeholder and Collection views lets you create Commitments in bulk. The new button is labeled Commitments and has two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Selected</span>: attempts to create Commitments for all highlighted rows (Placeholder Collections / Placeholders)</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">All</span>: attempts to create Commitments for all rows</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reviewing Target Sales in the Placeholder and Collection views </h4>
        <p>A new <span class="Emphasis">Target Report</span> view has been added to the Placeholder and Collection views. The <span class="Emphasis">Target Report</span> view displays existing Target Scenario values and allows you to input new target values based on the currently selected parameters in the main planning view. The <span class="Emphasis">Target Report</span> view makes it easier for you to reconcile back to the original target when making changes. The new view is available via the <span class="Emphasis">View Selection</span> parameter.</p>
        <h4>Using historical sales data to create collections</h4>
        <p>The ability to use historical sales data to create new collections has been added to the Collections view. A new button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight</span> in the toolbar opens the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Collection Management</span> screen. The functionality available in the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Collection Management</span> screen is very similar to the existing functionality in the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen available in the Placeholder view.</p>
        <h4>Evaluating average sales across time periods with different numbers of sites </h4>
        <p>Two new metrics have been added to the Top Down Sales Plan view allowing you to evaluate the average sales when comparing between different time periods where the number of Sites may have changed. The two new metrics are:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../Resources/TableStyles/standard.css');" class="TableStyle-standard" cellspacing="0">

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4>Improved visibility to actual ROS and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales</h4>
        <p>Previous to 2020.4, the ROS&#160;metric reflected a combination of actual and planned sales in a single ROS&#160;metric. New metrics have been added that split actual and planned sales out. This provides better visibility to the actual ROS for  active sites and how aligned sales plans are with actual sales. The new metrics are available in the main planning view and the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view. </p>
        <p>The new metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reg Ftr Site Count, Reg Ftr ROS ($), Reg Ftr ROS (U), Reg Ftr Site ($), Reg Ftr Site (U), Reg Ftr AUR ($), Act ROS ($), Act ROS (U)</li>
            <li>SPV ROS ($), SPV ROS (U), </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Two existing metrics, SPV Sales ($) and SPV Sales (U), have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If at any point a user makes a change causing Total Sales Units to change, this will cascade down to the Regular Future figures as well.</p>

        <h4>Dismissing supporting views rather than removing them from the main planning view </h4>
        <p>To enhance usability while working with supporting views in the Placeholder and Collection views, a <span class="Emphasis">Home</span> button has been added to the header in the supporting views allowing users to dismiss a view rather than having to click <span class="Emphasis">x</span>  which removes the view altogether from view configuration.</p>
        <h4>Duplicating placeholders</h4>
        <p>The ability to copy or duplicate existing placeholders has been added to the Placeholder view. A&#160;new button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Copy</span> on the toolbar launches the <span class="Emphasis">Copy Placeholder</span> dialog in which you can specify how many copies to make and whether to include the new copied placeholders in Promotions that the placeholders could be part of. </p>
        <h3>Exceptions to exact duplication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the original item is Assigned or above, the Variant assignment is not copied into the duplicate. All data associated with a variant is not duplicated:<ul><li>Actualized sales, receipts, SOH</li></ul><ul><li>Planned orders from Order Manager or imported supplier order data</li></ul><ul><li>If the status of the original is Replen or Allocate, the Replenishment or Allocation links are not duplicated. For Replen items, the sales total will duplicate, but the sales plan (e.g. how that sales total is distributed across weeks) will not necessarily duplicate. This is recalculated according to the seasonality curve.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Receipt data is not copied. This must be regenerated by the engine.<ul><li>Receipt AUC is a weighted average by receipt units. Since receipt units are generated by the engine, the weightings may differ and thus AUC might be slightly different between original and duplicate.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Promotions are not duplicated. If <span class="Emphasis">Add to Promos?</span> is selected, the new duplicate evaluates all promotions it could be a part of and adds them. This would include any Promotions created since the original placeholder was created. Therefore, the copy’s promotion membership may or may not match original’s promotion membership.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grouping and freezing columns in the Placeholder and Collection views </h4>
        <p>New functionality has been added to the grids in the Placeholder and Collection views that lets you can group and freeze columns.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.3AP"></a>2020.3</h3>
        <h4>Enhanced Comparison report in the Top Down Sales Plan view <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-68094</MadCap:conditionalText></h4>
        <p>All snapshot data, including actualized and on order data, is included in the comparison. If a snapshot is compared to the plan immediately after creation, results are identical. If a snapshot is used for comparison some time after it has been taken, then the actualized periods as of the snapshot date are shown, and the future-planned periods as of the snapshot date are shown.</p>
        <h4>Displaying or hiding view options in Placeholder and Collection modes <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-69439</MadCap:conditionalText></h4>
        <p>A new system policy allows you to configure which view options display in the <span class="BodyWord">View Selection</span> parameter dropdown. The new system policy is labeled <span class="BodyWord">Hidden Items on the View Selection dropdown</span>. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Viewing the AUR grand total in the Top Down Sales Plan view <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-68072</MadCap:conditionalText></h4>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">AUR</span> has been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Grand Total</span> section in the <span class="BodyWord">Top down Sales Plan</span> view. The column displays the total for all months or across the time parameters selected. </p>
        <p>The calculation is: Grand Total AUR = Grand Total Sales / Grand Total Sales Units</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">
                        
		The AUR field is always locked and shaded gray to indicate it's not editable.</p>
        <h4>Enhanced ability to filter the Style Bank view </h4>
        <p>The following columns have been added to the Style Bank view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Color Code</li>
            <li>Style Code</li>
            <li>Style Desc</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Item creation and receipt plans</h4>
        <p>Whether receipt plans are generated automatically upon item creation is now controlled by a new system policy labeled <span class="BodyWord">Generate Receipts On New Item Creation</span>. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Displaying default product hierarchy levels associated with Cluster Sets </h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="BodyWord">Display products on Cluster Set</span> parameter now controls whether the <span class="BodyWord">Products</span> field displays in the <span class="BodyWord">Cluster Sets</span> dropdown. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Improvement to the Assortment Buy Sheet Report</h4>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">Assortment Buy Sheet Report</span> has been enhanced to reflect any override sales values in the Sales Plan or the Top Down Sales plan. Previously, the report did not show overrides when selected.</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the Attributes tab</h4>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">Attributes</span> tab has been enhanced to include support for multiple attribute types including boolean, numeric, dates, and strings. </p>
        <h4>Selecting colors in the current and historical grids in the Hindsight Placeholder Management view</h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <span class="BodyWord">Color Code</span> has been added to both the <span class="BodyWord">Current</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Historical</span> grids in the <span class="BodyWord">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> view. The column allows users to view color data for the placeholders / variants shown. The new column is editable on new lines.</p>
        <h4>Bulk copying of new placeholders from the Historical grid in the Hindsight Placeholder Management view</h4>
        <li>A new <span class="BodyWord">Copy</span> button lets users bulk select and copy placeholders in the <span class="BodyWord">Historical</span> grid. All details, attributes, and the new adjusted ROS, comparison stock and end date are copied.</li>
        <h4>Weighting stock received toward the beginning of a receipt plan</h4>
        <p>Two new fields within the Receipt Plan view allow users to weight the stock received toward the beginning of a receipt plan. The two new fields are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Min Pres Multiplier</span>: Multiplies the minimum presentation units quantity passed into the receipt engine by the value entered in this field for the number of weeks specified in <span class="BodyWord">Min Pres Multiplier No of Periods</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Min Pres Multiplier No of Periods</span>: The number of periods that the multiplier is in effect from the phase-in date. A value of zero means effectively there is no multiplier. Once the number of periods has expired the minimum presentation values return to the original value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">Min Pres Multiplier</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Min Pres Multiplier No of Periods</span> together have an effect on the receipt plan by weighting stock received toward the beginning of the receipt plan according to the values set.</p>
        <h4>Viewing source item details when placeholders are created by Smart Start or Hindsight</h4>
        <p>Four new columns have been added to the main planning view to provide details of source items when placeholders are created by Smart Start or Hindsight. The new columns are labeled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Origin Details</li>
            <li>Origin Date</li>
            <li>Origin User</li>
            <li>Origin Type</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Selecting products using Filters instead of Product Hierarchy in the Reconciliation screen</h4>
        <p>In the <span class="BodyWord">Reconciliation</span> screen, the <span class="BodyWord">Product Hierarchy</span> parameter has been replaced by the <span class="BodyWord">Product</span> parameter. This is to allow for the selection of products using Filters instead of Product Hierarchy. No functionality is lost as filters can be created based on Product Hierarchy. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This is a breaking change. For more information, see Breaking Changes.</p>
        <h4>Customizing the columns included in the Current and Historical views </h4>
        <p>Users now have the ability to customize which columns appear in the Hindsight Placeholder Management screen. Right-click in either grid header and select the new menu option <span class="BodyWord">Column Chooser</span> to customize the columns that appear in the <span class="BodyWord">Current</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Historical</span> views.</p>
        <h4>New metrics added to the Target Worksheet </h4>
        <p>The following metrics have been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Target Worksheet</span> in the <span class="BodyWord">Target Creation</span> screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Comparison Site Count - average of snapshots from comparison time period</p>
                <p>A new system policy (<span class="BodyWord">Use &#160;Comparison Cluster Set Snapshots for Comparison Data</span>) dictates whether comparison snapshots are used to aggregate comparison data, or future-dated snapshots are used to aggregate comparison data. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
                <p>Comparison Site Count will always reference the cluster set snapshots relevant to comparison periods, regardless of the system policy setting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
			TY Plan Site Count - average of snapshots per period of target time period </li>
            <li>ROS $ - one for each metric group (Comparison, Comparison Reg, Comparison Promo, Comparison Markdown, Comparison Active, TY Plan, TY C/O, TY C/O Reg, TY C/O Promo, TY C/O Markdown, TY New Item, TY Act New)</li>
            <li>ROS U - one for each metric group (same as above)
               
			</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The total is 26 new fields. </p>
        <h4>Identifying sales and stock at non-assorted sites </h4>
        <p>Users can now easily identify placeholder-variants which have stock and/or sales outside of the defined clusters (generally a result of stock being returned to a site which was not originally included in the assortment clusters, or from other omni-channel related activities). This helps provide a more complete picture of sales by including those sales that occurred outside of the assorted cluster for a placeholder or variant. All decisions regarding what to do once the threshold is reached or exceeded are user driven and not system driven. </p>
        <p>For example, users may or may not decide to include the site in a cluster set moving forward. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If a site was excluded from a cluster definition last week but is included in this week’s snapshot, then last week’s sales and stock are considered as being to a non-assorted site, but this week’s would be to an assorted site.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing sales and stock at non-assorted sites</h4>
        <p>To provide visibility to this data which is collected for non-DC type sites, two new fields labeled <span class="BodyWord">OOT Sales</span> and <span class="BodyWord">OOT Stock</span> have been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Placeholder</span>, <span class="BodyWord">Collection</span>, and <span class="BodyWord">Hindsight</span> views.</p>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">OOT Sales</span>: Indicates that there have been noteworthy sales of units at non-assorted sites. This helps provide a total picture of sales including those sales outside of the assorted cluster for a placeholder or variant. </p>
        <p class="p"><span class="BodyWord">OOT Stock</span>: Whether the item  meets or exceeds the threshold at the product hierarchy level for the number of units in stock at sites that were not originally assorted to. A mark indicates the threshold has been met or exceeded.</p>
        <h4>Assortment Out-of-Tier Report</h4>
        <p>A new supporting view in Placeholder mode labeled <span class="BodyWord">Assortment Out-of-Tier Report</span> (not available in Collection mode) lets you select a placeholder with sales or stock at a non-assorted site and drill down further into the data. The  <span class="BodyWord">Assortment Out-of-Tier Report</span> view can still display data even when the <span class="BodyWord">OOT&#160;Sales</span> and <span class="BodyWord">OOT Stock</span> fields are not marked. This is because the threshold for sales or stock was not met or exceeded.</p>
        <h4>Setting the threshold</h4>
        <p>Thresholds for sales and stock at non-assorted sites are set in the <span class="BodyWord">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab.</p>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">Out-of-Tier Sales Units Threshold</span>: If set, a threshold at the product hierarchy level for the number of units sold outside an assorted cluster. Once the threshold is met or exceeded the check box in the <span class="BodyWord">OOT Sales</span> field in the Placeholder, Collection, and Hindsight (both Current and Historical) views is checked.</p>
        <p>If not set, then there is no threshold and no action is taken.</p>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">Out-of-Tier Stock Units Threshold</span>: If set, a threshold at the product hierarchy level for the number of units in stock at sites that were not originally assorted to. Once the threshold is met or exceeded the check box in the <span class="BodyWord">OOT Stock</span> field in the Placeholder, Collection, and Hindsight (both Current and Historical) views is checked.</p>
        <p>The threshold is at the placeholder level, dependent on selected cluster filters. Therefore, if the stock on hand product hierarchy threshold for a placeholder is set to 500 units, and there are two cluster sets, A and B, each of which had 250 units stock on hand, then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the check box is not marked if only cluster A or only cluster B are selected.</li>
            <li>if both clusters are selected, the check box is marked as the combined selected cluster sets meet the threshold.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Including or excluding receipt override quantities when a commitment is generated</h4>
        <p>With the new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Remove User Override Receipt Units on Commit</span>, users now have the ability to choose whether to include receipt override quantities when a commitment is generated. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <p>To improve consistency, the <span class="Emphasis">Stock To Sales</span> metrics in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view have been updated to calculate in the same way as the <span class="Emphasis">Stock To Sales</span> metrics in the <span class="Emphasis">Top Down Sales Plan</span> view. </p>
        <p>The calculation is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaf level Stock Units to Sales Units = BOP Units / Sales Units</li>
            <li>Aggregating stock to sales over time = (First period BOP + all periods' incremental incoming stock) / Sum of Sales Units</li>
            <li>Aggregating metrics within a period = Sum of BOP / Sum of Sales Units = Geography / Product Total STS</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Comparing plan rollups to target creation </h4>
        <p>The Assortment Reconciliation report has been extended to give users the ability to compare the rollup of an assortment plan to the target creation to determine the closeness to hitting targets. The new comparison type is <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Target Scenario</span>.</p>
        <h4>Capturing changes to the initial Sales Plan in Target Creation </h4>
        <p>A new system policy, <span class="Emphasis">Reference sales override values for Carryover Sales in Target Creation</span>, controls whether any revisions made to the initial sales plan are captured by Target Creation. If the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, a user’s changes to the sales plan are captured by Target Creation. The default is <span class="Emphasis">False</span> (OFF) meaning Target Creation does not pick up any revisions since the initial creation of the Sales Plan.</p>
        <h4>Selecting custom DC split factor types </h4>
        <p>The ability to select different stock splitting preferences for distribution centers that are servicing multiple sites has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> screen. Users can select the <span class="Emphasis">DC&#160;Split Factor Type</span> field on the <span class="Emphasis">General</span> tab and choose the desired DC&#160;split factor.</p>
        <h4>Defining the percentage of DC receipts that Cluster Set Clusters receive </h4>
        <p>To define the percentage of DC receipts that Cluster Set Clusters receive, select the <span class="Emphasis">DC&#160;Stock Split Factor</span> tab that has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> screen. Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">DC&#160;Stock Split Factor</span> tab displays the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Split Factors</span> screen which has a pivot grid with fields by distribution center (DC), cluster set, and cluster.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Manage Split Factor screen.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h4>Identifying how many placeholders in a promotion are assorted to a site </h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Placeholders Assorted to Site</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Promotion Locations</span> view to show how many placeholders that are part of a promotion are actually assorted to each site.</p>
        <h4>Automatically including new placeholders in all applicable existing promotions </h4>
        <p>New placeholders can now be automatically included in all applicable existing promotions by selecting a new check box. The new check box is labeled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Add to Promos?</span> in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholders</span> screen and the <span class="Emphasis">Hindsight Placeholder Management</span> screen</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Add New Placeholders to Promotions?</span> in the Target Creation screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Whether the check box is checked by default is determined by the new system policy <span class="Emphasis">New Placeholders Added to Promotions Default</span>.</p>
        <p class="p">This new functionality is also influenced by the new system policy <span class="Emphasis">New Placeholders Added to Promotions Filter Limit</span>. </p>
        <h4>Extending the markdown date in Placeholders and its effect on the regular ROS&#160;and the markdown ROS</h4>
        <p>As of v2020.1, extending the markdown date in a Placeholder no longer changes the regular ROS&#160;and the markdown ROS. </p>
        <h3><a name="2019.45"></a>2019.4</h3>
        <h4>Using temporal DC stock splits to determine expected receipt stock across multiple DCs</h4>
        <p>Previously within the Assortment Planning module, the standard non-temporal DC split factor functionality determined the division of expected receipt stock across multiple distribution centers. </p>
        <p>As of version 2019.4, Planners can now use temporal DC split factor functionality to define which cluster sets and clusters are serviced by which distribution center  while taking into account the sales projections for the sites within the cluster sets and clusters. This improves the receipt flow into multiple distribution centers by accounting for time-based selling of the sites being serviced by each DC.</p>
        <p>The non-temporal DC split functionality is the default.  The default to use is determined by a new system policy labeled <b>Default Supply Chain</b> (located under <b>General: Planning</b>). </p>
        <h4>Changing which DC&#160;stock split method to use</h4>
        <p>The method for selecting DC&#160;stock splits can be changed via a new field labeled <b>DC Split Factor Type</b> which has been added to the <b>General</b> tab of the <b>Manage Assortment Plans</b> screen. The system default displays as <b>Legacy AP</b>. This new field determines the division of expected receipt stock across the appropriate distribution centers.</p>
        <h4>Improved visibility to promotions applied to placeholders across time and cluster </h4>
        <p> The <b>Assortment Planning</b> module now includes a new <b>Promotion Detail View</b> tab that provides flexibility and visibility to promotions applied to placeholders across time and cluster. This lets users effectively manage all active placeholder promotions at one time in one view. </p>
        <p>Promotions are primarily defined in the <b>Promotion Application</b> section. Previously, users had to choose a filter, cluster sets, and a date range and got an error if no items fell in the combination of choices. The definitions have been relaxed. Users can now create completely empty Promotion Applications to enable adding promotion items in the new <b>Promotion Detail View</b> tab. </p>
        <h4>Improved user flow for creating and editing collections </h4>
        <p>A new right-click menu option labeled <b>Multiple Changes</b> allows users to quickly and efficiently create and edit multiple collections simultaneously.</p>
        <h4>Setting defaults for new placeholders at a particular product hierarchy-cluster level</h4>
        <p>A new <b>Assortment Plan Defaults By Cluster</b> view gives users the ability to apply a different default value to new placeholders in different cluster set clusters so that expected differences in the sales plans can be captured based on how items within those clusters typically behave. This new view is accessed by clicking the <b>Manage</b> button in the Assortment Planning module and selecting <b>Defaults</b>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Assortment Plan Defaults By Cluster tab.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Cluster Sets</b> parameter filters the results brought back based on the cluster set selection. Within the grid, users can set any of four default parameters for any level of the hierarchy for any cluster set cluster. The parameters are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seasonality Curve</li>
            <li>Minimum Presentation</li>
            <li>Periods of Supply</li>
            <li>Min Stk/Sales</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can update multiple rows simultaneously by right-clicking in the field to be updated and choosing <b>Multiple Changes</b> from the menu.</li>
            <li>
                <p>When multiple default values are in conflict with one another, the more granular value is applied. For example, a lower level product default is applied over a higher level product-cluster default.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Previewing a seasonality curve’s application</h4>
        <p>The lookup fields for seasonality curve in both the product hierarchy defaults and the product hierarchy-cluster defaults has been replaced with the curve selection pop-out. This provides additional information related to curve selection.</p>
        <h4>Adjusting seasonal indexes and sales plans based on site cluster snapshots</h4>
        <p>Assortment Planning now allows seasonal indexes and sales plans to be scaled based on future site cluster snapshots when a new system policy labeled <b>Toggle on/off snapshot aware seasonal index calculation</b> is set to <b>True</b> (ON). </p>
        <p>Users can create future site cluster snapshots containing different site counts than the current period site cluster snapshots. This produces sales plans which better reflect expectations for product sales in the constituent stores.</p>
        <h4>New filter metadata for new product life cycle metrics</h4>
        <p>The following new filters and respective metadata have been created to filter metrics based on Regular or Markdown sales plan data. These filters are available from the Assortment Plan Data Placeholder and Cluster levels.</p>

        <p class="note">Changes that are saved are then updated to the individual item plan.</p>
        <h4>Setting default time periods between a markdown date and a phase out date </h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <b>Number of Markdown Periods</b> has been added to the <b>Manage Assortment Defaults</b> screen. Setting a value in <b>Number of Markdown Periods</b> sets a standard default time period between markdown and phase out dates meaning pre-season plans are more consistent and more accurately account for markdown sales during planning. The default is used to determine what the phase out date should be from the markdown date, once a user enters a markdown date during Placeholder creation.</p>
        <p>For example, if the default is 4 and the markdown date is 4/29, then the phase out date will be 5/27 which is four weeks post markdown.</p>
        <h4>Linking markdown and phase out dates </h4>
        <p>Markdown and phase out dates can be linked together by selecting a new column labeled <b>Markdown Offset Lock</b>. Selecting <b>Markdown Offset Lock</b> ensures the two dates work dependently on each other ensuring users can accurately plan the entire life of the item including markdowns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the user changes <b>Markdown Date</b>, then the value in <b>Phase Out</b> automatically changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.
			</li>
            <li>If the user changes <b>Phase Out</b>, then the value in <b>Markdown Date</b> automatically changes to keep the specified number of periods between them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Markdown Offset Lock</b> can be selected on the <b>Hindsight</b> and <b>Manage Assortment Defaults</b> screens.</p>
        <h4>New and revised Sell Through metrics in to the main planning view </h4>
        <p>To assist in the planning of the Sell Through % prior to markdown and markdown to phase out, three new Sell Through metrics have been added to the main planning view for both Placeholder and Collection modes and one existing Sell Through metric has been revised. The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Target S/T %</li>
            <li>S/T %</li>
            <li>Reg S/T %</li>
            <li>S/T % Delta</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Using default ratios to automatically plan post-markdown sales units amounts </h4>
        <p>Default ratios can now be set using a new column labeled <b>Markdown Sales Plan Factor</b> that has been added to the <b>Manage Assortment Defaults</b> screen. This new column lets users automatically plan post-markdown sales units amounts to more efficiently plan Assortments.</p>
        <h4>Preventing the system from ordering additional stock past the planned markdown date </h4>
        <p>When set to <b>False</b>, a new system policy labeled <b>Allow Receipts After Markdown</b> (Maintain &gt; Policies &gt; Engine: Commitments) prevents the system from ordering additional stock past the planned markdown date. The default is <b>False</b>. Set the system policy to <b>True</b> if additional stock should be ordered beyond the planned markdown date.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing pre-markdown and post-markdown metrics in Placeholder mode</h4>
        <p>The following columns have been added to the grid in the Placeholder mode allowing users to review pre-markdown and post-markdown metrics:</p>

        <h4>Reviewing markdown planning changes in the <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen </h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <b>Markdown</b> has been added to the <b>Hindsight Placeholder Management</b> screen. The new column is located between the phase dates.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing placeholders with a markdown date </h4>
        <p>If you select a Placeholder with a markdown date, then the Cluster Sets view refreshes to display a View Style dropdown at the top of the view. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Set View View Style option.PNG" />

        <h4>Setting the maximum date for a Target </h4>
        <p>A new mandatory field has been added to the Target Creation module. The dropdown menu for the new field has two options: <b>Phase Out Date</b> and <b>Markdown Date</b>. The default is <b>Phase Out Date</b>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a user selects Phase Out Date, then the maximum date will be the phase out date.</li>
            <li>If a user selects Markdown Date, then the maximum date will be the Markdown Date, and Phase Out will be calculated based on the default markdown logic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>New visibility to the difference between internal commitments and external orders </h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <b>On Order Exception</b> has been added to the <b>Assortment Receipt Plan</b> view. This new metric displays the discrepancy when the internal and external order quantities and dates do not match exactly.</p>
        <h4>Hold Sales function revised for markdown items </h4>
        <p>Hold Sales functionality has been revised to not redistribute sales during a markdown period to ensure that the Total Sales for a plan is preserved while applying a promotion.</p>
        <h4>Supplemental Commitments </h4>
        <p>You can make supplemental commitments during a period within which an existing commitment order already exists. These additional commitment orders are supplemental and are neither an update nor a replacement. The ability to create a supplemental commitment is controlled by the Allow supplemental commitments system policy.</p>
        <h4>Placeholder description field </h4>
        <p>A new field labeled <b>Placeholder Desc</b> has been added to the Sales Plan view and the Receipt Plan view.</p>

        <h4>New additional sales by price type metrics for comparison and carryover data</h4>
        <p>There are new additional sales by type metrics in the Target Creation worksheet for comparison data and carryover data. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comparison Reg Sales $</li>
            <li>Comparison Reg Sales U</li>

        <h4>Clusters with zero sites</h4>
        <p>Two new columns (Health Error and Health Error Details) and a health indicator (Health %) have been added to provide more visibility if a cluster has zero sites in a time frame so assortments can be better planned.</p>
        <h4>Assorting based on future cluster sets</h4>
        <p>Functionality has been added to allow assorting based on current and future cluster sets, depending on the time period being worked with, to avoid assortment plans being over- or under-estimated.</p>

        <h4>Viewing Promotion markdowns in Hybrid Cost Dual Markdown (HCDM) based plans</h4>
        <p>Existing functionality displays Promotion markdown values in HCDM plans as 0 once a period has been actualized. New functionality actualizes Promotion markdown values in HCDM&#160;plans using the following calculation: Promotion Markdown = Total Original Retail - Total Revenue.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/HCDM Promo MD.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>However, the value that displays represents the total of markdowns (both Permanent and Promotion). This is because it is not possible to reliably determine which portion of the value represents Permanent or Promotion markdowns from standard data imports. Actualized values for Permanent markdown metrics will be zeros.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Hybrid Cost Dual Markdown plans are for organizations who wish to plan their permanent and promotional markdowns separately.</p>
        <h4>New metrics for all Hybrid plan types (Cost, Retail, and HCDM)</h4>

        <h4>Using keystroke shortcuts to reduce data entry</h4>
        <p>The usability of the Merchandise Financial Planning module has been enhanced. Users can now use keystroke shortcuts when entering large numbers. Selecting one of the shortcuts inputs a series of zeros (with any required separating commas) behind an entered numeric value. For example, entering the number 5 and pressing K inputs 5,000.</p>
        <p>Keystrokes can be combined. For example, 2KK results in 2,000,000 and 3CK results in 300,000.</p>
        <p>The new shortcuts are:</p>

        <h4>Creating original plans</h4>
        <p>A new <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span> Plan Sub Type has been introduced for Hybrid branches only. The two options for Plan Sub Type are <span class="Emphasis">Default</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span>.  The distinction between the two choices lies in the treatment of periods that are in the past (e.g. last week and prior).  The characteristics of past periods in each Plan Sub Type are as follows:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Default</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>disable editability of metrics in past periods</li>
            <li>formats cells within the past periods to signify “past”</li>
            <li>surfaces actual values instead of “plan values”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>allow editability of metrics in past periods</li>
            <li>cell formatting does not change between past and future periods</li>
            <li>surfaces planned values in all periods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above descriptions define behavior for the base metrics (e.g. "TY" metrics).  LY metrics (and LLY metrics, if that is selected as the Comparison Type for display) DO actualize.  The behavior for LY and LLY metrics in both Default and Original Plan types is the same.</p>

            <li>The Original Plan Sub Type is only available to Hybrid plan types.</li>
            <li>Master plans cannot be set to Original Plan Sub Type; Master plans must always be Default.  Their branches, however, can be either Sub Type.</li>
            <li>Branches can be switched between Default and Original Plan throughout their life, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Branches of various Sub Types can be Merged and Re-Seeded.  For Default Sub Type plans, only future periods are allowed for these operations.  For Original Plan Sub Type plans, all periods are allowed for these operations.</li>

        <h4>Copying and pasting data into and within financial plans</h4>
        <p>v2021.3 introduces the ability to copy and paste data either directly into a financial plan from spreadsheets and from one section to another section within a financial plan. This is a significant process improvement for planners who perform calculations and other planning functions in applications such as MS&#160;Excel. While the copy and paste process is essentially the same as standard copying and pasting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you cannot paste onto a non-editable cell (non-editable cells are skipped)</li>
            <li>the focused cell or top-left cell of the selection on the pivot grid (in the case of a multi-select) must be editable. If the focused cell is not editable, then the Paste option is not shown.</li>
            <li>if you paste onto a normal cell and then a total cell (e.g. paste into Week 2021_wk34 and 2021_m08 total at the same time) then the lower level value is overwritten by the total cell.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2021.2MFP"></a>2021.2</h3>
        <h4>Holding Target BOP to Sales or holding Stock to Sales</h4>
        <p>When adjusting Sales, existing functionality held the planned Stock to Sales and adjusted the Target BOP. A new calculation toggle has been added to all three hybrid plan types: Cost, Retail, and Cost Dual markdown. This new calculation allows for holding the Target BOP when adjusting Sales with the Stock to Sales changing.</p>
        <p>The two calculations can be selected using the new calculation toggle <span class="Emphasis">Sales to Target BOP</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">HOLD: Stock to Sales | CALC: Target BOP</span> (Default behavior as of v2021.2)</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">HOLD: Target BOP | CALC: Stock to Sales</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The new calculation is especially useful when the organizational direction is that Target BOPs are held and cannot change without approval. In this situation, holding Target BOP can be set as the default.</p>
        <p>When you allow the Target BOP to change, there may be situations where the stock for a certain product hierarchy cannot be acquired but you do want to increase your Sales Plan. You can toggle the calculation as a one-off where the Target BOP holds resulting in Stock to Sales being a little faster.</p>
        <p>However, because you are changing Sales you will need to consider the calculation toggle settings for both the <span class="Emphasis">Sales</span> toggle and the <span class="Emphasis">Sales to Target BOP</span> toggle.</p>
        <h4>Creating snapshots with FX neutralization (FXN) enabled</h4>
        <p>Previously with FXN mode enabled, when you created a snapshot the FXN conversion rate as at the snapshot creation date applied to future periods in the plan. This is problematic as conversion rates vary over time. Therefore, FXN functionality has been enhanced for v2021.2 to capture FXN values in plans, based on the last time FXN was run. </p>
        <p>The consequence of this enhancement is that the date of the last time FXN functionality was run may not be the same date as the snapshot creation date.</p>
        <p>To allow you to cross reference the FXN and snapshot creation dates, a new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Last FXN Date</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">MFP Snapshots</span> section of the <span class="Emphasis">Snapshots</span> tab in the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view. This new metric displays the date FXN was last recalculated for future periods. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The metric updates whenever you select <span class="Emphasis">FXN Recalc</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> screen or run nightly or weekly jobs. </p>
        <p>As a result of this enhancement, snapshots are a current picture of a plan regardless of whether FXN mode is enabled or disabled (snapshot behavior has not changed if FXN mode is disabled). </p>

        <p>Users can update FXN values with planned values using the new <span class="BodyWord">FXN Recalc</span> button in the Financial Maintenance Plan screen toolbar. This button is visible on the toolbar when system policy <span class="BodyWord">Enable FX Neutralization in MFP</span> is set to True. The <span class="BodyWord">FXN Recalc</span> button is enabled when the user has rights to edit the plan.</p>

        <h4>Updating the stock split factor</h4>
        <p>Users now have the ability to select a custom DC split factor. A new field labeled <span class="BodyWord">Stock Split Factor Type</span> indicates the currently selected stock split factor type. To choose a different split factor type, click <span class="BodyWord">Edit</span> to display the <span class="BodyWord">Maintain Financial Plan</span> screen and select a different split factor in the <span class="BodyWord">Stock Split Factor Type</span> field on the <span class="BodyWord">General</span> tab.</p>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">DC Stock Split Factor</span> tab has been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Maintain Financial Plan</span> screen. This tab has a pivot grid with fields by DC, cluster set, and cluster.</p>

        <h4>Metrics adjusted for foreign exchange (FX) rates</h4>
        <p>Previously, FX neutralized LY metrics (Sales $ and Margin $) were added to Hybrid plan types. These metrics allow businesses to plan by referencing comparable LY/LLY data using current exchange rates applied to both TY and LY/LLY values.</p>
        <p>As of v2019.4, all processes that handle standard metrics have been updated to handle FX neutralized metrics as well. There are no new metrics. The designated LY metrics will either display non-FX neutralized numbers if the <span class="BodyWord">Currency Neutralization</span> dropdown is set to <span class="BodyWord">Standard</span> or they will display FX neutralized numbers if the dropdown is set to <span class="BodyWord">LY Neutralized</span>.</p>

        <p>Two new comparison types let users review Assortment Plan data within the Merchandise Financial Planning module. Users can now easily reference Assortment Plan data while working on Financial Plans without having to go back and forth between two screens. This helps ensure that Financial Plans and Assortment Plans align for accurate forecasting and buying. The new comparison types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>vs. Assortment Plan - compares the plan's metrics against a particular Assortment Plan.</li>
            <li>vs. Assortment Plan Snapshot - compare the plan's metrics against a particular snapshot of an Assortment Plan.</li>

        <h4>Planning strategies before stock arrives at distribution centers </h4>
        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view is a single column pivot grid that lets you create Allocation Strategies and start working on them before you start Allocating. You can use the <span class="Emphasis">Item Filter</span> dropdown field to filter which Variants (style/color) to display. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Your assigned site permissions determine which channels you can activate. For the site based permissions, if you have permission for at least one site, then you have permission to the entire channel (i.e. you can see the entire column for that channel).  If all your sites belong in only one channel, then you will only see one column.</p>

        <p>Allocation Strategies that have already been created are check marked in the <span class="Emphasis">Activate?</span> column and greyed out. The cells for Channels that have not been activated against a particular Variant are formatted white with the check boxes in the <span class="Emphasis">Activate?</span>&#160;field being unchecked. To activate a Channel, select the <span class="Emphasis">Activate?</span>&#160;check box and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. The <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view automatically refreshes and the cell is formatted to indicate the strategy has been created.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Created and existing strategies cannot be deleted in the <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view. (There is an existing nightly job that deprecates strategies.)</p>
        <h4>Setting a system default for creating strategies as omni-channel or not </h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Generate Omni Channel Strategies</span> defines whether new strategies are created as omni-channel or not.  If set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, then you can generate a strategy with multiple channels. If you execute the same variant different times with different channels each time, different strategies are created with Each Execution even though this is set to omni-channel.</p>
        <p>If set to <span class="Emphasis">False</span>, then you generate one strategy per channel variant. Changing the setting does not affect existing strategies. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Setting the allowed channels for strategies</h4>
        <p>The functionality of the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> view has been enhanced to let users set which channels are allowed for strategies. Using the <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view means always creating new strategies. To add channels in existing strategies without going into the <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Activation</span> view and creating unwanted strategies, you can click within the <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> field and select the ellipsis to display the <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> dialog. You can use the <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Channels</span> dialog to add and remove channels as needed. </p>
        <h4>Using inventory policies to manage minimum safety stock within Allocation Strategies</h4>
        <p> v2021.4 introduces the ability to use inventory policies to manage minimum safety stock within Allocation Strategies. You can review the dynamic safety stock policies associated with strategies using the new <span class="Emphasis">Dynamic Policy</span> blade added to the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> view. Using dynamic minimum safety stock policy values for allocation managed items lets you more effectively manage both minimum safety stock values over time and safety stock at the SKU-location level.
		</p>
        <p>
		An Allocation Strategy can have multiple dynamic safety stock policies for different time frames with all the policies being taken into account. The Allocation Strategy goes back to the normal stock holding pattern once a policy's end date has been reached. You can navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Stock Holding Projection</span> blade in Inventor Manager to see the impact of dynamic safety stock policies.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">

		The dynamic policy values are managed in the Policy module.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Dynamic Policy</span> blade has two sections: <span class="Emphasis">Inventory</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Policy</span>.
		</p>
        <h4>
			Inventory section

		</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Inventory</span> section displays information relating to the item/site. Only inventories with dynamic safety stock policies display. Inventories that do not have dynamic safety stock policies do not display.

		</p>
        <h4>Policy section

		</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Policy</span> section displays the dynamic minimum safety stock units for that inventory.</p>
        <h4>Identifying which strategies have associated dynamic safety stock policies</h4>
        <p>

			Within the Allocation Strategy view, a column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Dynamic SS Policies</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> grid. The check box in this column provides a convenient way to quickly scroll through the displayed strategies to find strategies that have associated dynamic safety stock policies. If the check box is checked, then there are associated dynamic safety stock policies. If unchecked, there are no associated dynamic safety stock policies.
		</p>
        <h4>
		Setting new Allocation Strategies to source from Assortment Planning</h4>
        <p>Previously, you could not set a strategy to source from Assortment Planning (AP) without capturing a Phase In date in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> screen. However, Phase In dates are set in AP and then pushed to Allocations. A constraint that checked on Phase In date when setting the source to AP has been removed. This allows users to set the source to AP even if the Phase In date is null or in the past.</p>
        <p>Users working within both Allocations and Assortment Planning now have the ability to push AP data to Allocations significantly improving the alignment of Assortment and Allocation strategies within business teams.</p>
        <p> If set to <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Planning</span>, then the following are pushed from the Assortment Planning module to the Allocations module:
		<ul><li><p> Phase In and Phase Out dates</p></li><li><p>Size Curve</p></li><li><p>Minimum safety stock units</p></li><li><p>Cluster Sets</p></li><li><p>Rate of Sales</p></li></ul><p class="BasicNote">The above pushed fields are read-only in the Allocations module.</p></p>
        <h4>Identifying sites by their site code</h4>
        <p>As users generally identify Sites by their Site Code and to ensure a consistent work flow, a column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Site Code</span> has been added to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Allocate Strategy Store And Size Contribution section of the <span class="Emphasis">Allocate Strategy Product Model Link</span> blade in the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> view.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Override Site</span> column in the <span class="Emphasis">Size Model Detail</span> grid in the <span class="Emphasis">Size Models</span> view.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Easier visualization of SiteCode and SiteName </h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">SiteCodeName</span> has been added to the pivot grid on the Product Model screen. This new metric allows for easier visualization of both SiteCode and SiteName.</p>
        <h4> Visibility to when the Assortment Planning module last updated the Allocations module</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Last AP Push</span> has been added to the Allocation Strategy grid. This new metric gives visibility to when the Assortment Planning module last updated the Allocations module.</p>
        <h4>Viewing when a product model was last recalculated </h4>
        <p>You can now easily determine when a product model was last recalculated using two new columns added to the Product Model grid. The two new columns are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Last Calculated - the date of the last recalculation.</li>
            <li>Calculated By - who performed the last recalculation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2021.3AL"></a>2021.3</h3>
        <h4>Associating strategies with particular channels</h4>
        <p>v2021.3 extends strategy creation. Previously, a strategy acted as an omni-channel strategy in that a single strategy covered all existing channels. Regardless of how many Allocators at a company, the particular set of items would be defined once with different sets of sites. New functionality lets you configure one strategy per channel (for example, if you have 5 channels then you create 5 strategies). This enhancement better reflects how businesses operate, offers much greater flexibility, and eliminates having to customize workarounds to achieve the same effect.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The default is one strategy covering all channels (omni-channel). </p>
        <p> A migration script creates either a single strategy (omni-channel) if there is one unique strategy (i.e. a non-repeating Level ID&#160;or a style/color) or multiple channels based of the existing configured Location Strategies. Additionally, a nightly process lets customers choose whether to auto-generate new strategies in an omni-channel fashion or one per existing channels.</p>
        <p>If further customization is required, a customization hook gives the ability to define a new strategy by particular sets of channels. So, the first strategy might cover 3 channels while the next strategy might cover the next 4 channels. </p>
        <h4>Building product models based on hierarchy product levels</h4>
        <p>Allocators can now build product models based on desired hierarchy levels. This allows product models to be optimized for desired business distributions. For example, seasonality and department. </p>
        <h4>Strategy Relations blade</h4>
        <p>The existing <span class="Emphasis">Prepack</span> blade has been renamed <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relations</span>. The <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relations</span> blade gives you visibility into the relationship, if any, between strategies and between strategies and any configured prepacks. The blade includes a new section labeled <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relationship</span> and an existing section labeled <span class="Emphasis">Prepack Configuration</span>.</p>
        <p>Selecting a strategy in the top grid displays any related strategies in the <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relationship</span> section. The related strategies are identified using their Allocate Strategy ID.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is important to note that there is only one stock-on-hand for the multiple channels sharing the same Variant. Therefore, it is recommended that you should first run the strategy with the most important channel and verify the order. Once satisfied, you can then repeat the process with the other strategies to avoid over allocation.</p>
        <p>For more information, see Channels in the Allocation section under Breaking Changes.</p>
        <h4>Changes to the Allocation module UI</h4>
        <p>The following fields have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Allocation Strategy</span> tab:</p>

        <h3><a name="2021.2AL"></a>2021.2</h3>
        <h4>Enhanced Allocation save options</h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Allocate Projection Save Options</span> allows users to specify which projection fields they want to save for an Allocation Engine. If a client does not use a certain field, they can remove the value from the system policy and that may lead to faster save back times. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h4>Aggregate Size Curves across all sites</h4>
        <p>A new Aggregate Size Curves grid has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Size Models</span> screen. This grid lets you review and manipulate Aggregate Size Curves. </p>

        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Prepack</span> blade gives you more visibility into prepacks and a better understanding of prepack relationships in Allocation strategies. The blade includes two blades: <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relationship</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Prepack Configuration</span>. </p>
        <p>The first blade, <span class="Emphasis">Strategy Relationship</span>, lists all Allocation Strategies that relate to the currently selected strategy and displays information on related prepack strategies. You can use this information to ensure the prepack strategies are configured correctly.
		</p>
        <p>The second blade, <span class="Emphasis">PrePack Configuration</span>, lists all related prepacks linked to the selected Allocation strategy, based on ItemMasters linked to the Strategy. This provides a better understanding of what is within a prepack. </p>
        <h3><a name="2020.4AL"></a>2020.4</h3>
        <h4>Increased insight into Site Capacity values in the Allocation Rollup screen</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Maximum Capacity</span> has been added to the Allocation Rollup screen. This metric is the Site Capacity as defined within the <span class="Emphasis">Site Capacity Temporal</span> tab within Site Manager. This field only displays rounded numbers for maximum capacity values and is highlighted when the value is exceeded. </p>
        <p>For more information, see Site Manager.</p>

        <h4>All instances of the label Size Curve have been changed to Size Model</h4>
        <p>Within the Allocations module, all instances of the label <span class="BodyWord">Size Curve</span> have been changed to <span class="BodyWord">Size Model</span>. This was done as <span class="BodyWord">Size Model</span> is a more accurate representation of what is being worked on within the module, so the label was changed to more accurately reflect such.</p>
        <p>Future enhancements will be made to correct any remaining instances of <span class="BodyWord">Size Curve</span> to <span class="BodyWord">Size Model</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.38"></a>2019.3</h3>
        <h4>Setting the prepack threshold and prepack run mode strategy line</h4>
        <p>Two new columns in the Allocation Strategy grid in the Allocation module allow users to set the strategy line prepack threshold and prepack run mode. The columns are labeled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="BodyWord">Maximum Prepack Overage Allowed</span>

        <h4>Creating Save Points for Allocation Strategies </h4>
        <p>A new column on the Allocation Strategy screen labeled Create Save Point gives users the ability to create a Save Point. If a user selects Create Save Point for a particular strategy and then clicks Save, the system takes all the information relating to the strategy including location exceptions and saves the settings for the strategy. Users can then go to the Allocation Strategy Save Point screen and mass apply a Save Point to all the variants in the Item Filter.</p>
        <p>The Create Save Point Before Restore function creates another Save Point saving variant settings before a restore.</p>
        <h4>Demand Transference</h4>
        <p>Users can now consider Demand Transference within the Allocations module. To include or exclude this logic, navigate to Management &gt; Inventory Manager and select the Consider Demand Transference checkbox for one or more items.</p>
        <h4>Product Model Calculation</h4>
        <p>By default (system policy Allocate.ProductModel.UseAdvanced is set to False), the product model calculation uses the MEDIAN to produce the average values. If the new system policy Allocate.ProductModel.UseAdvanced is set to True, then the calculation will use the MEAN.</p>
        <h4>Two new columns have been added to the Product Model grid</h4>
        <p>The new column Include Inner Zeros lets you selectively include or exclude inner zero periods from the consideration sample. New column Include Lost Sales allows for the inclusion of lost sales in the product model calculation, potentially preventing a situation wherein a store was out of stock and thus negatively affecting the product model.</p>
        <h2>Causal Manager </h2>
        <h3><a name="2021.4CAU"></a>2021.4</h3>
        <h4>Generating Causals in response to external data</h4>
        <p>v2021.4 introduces new functionality that allows for the creation of Causals based on external signal data supplied by Planalytics. Causals created based on external signal data can be configured and reviewed using three new blades in Causal Manager. The blades are: <span class="Emphasis">Signal Subscriptions</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Weather Signals</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Planalytics Variant Segment Link</span>.</p>
        <h4>Signal Subscriptions</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Signal Subscriptions</span> blade displays the current subscriptions and is primarily informational. </p>
        <h4>Accessing the Signal Subscriptions blade</h4>
        <p>The following  is required to be able to view this blade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Right (Right Group: External Signals) <span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to Signal Subscriptions</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>System policy (Module: External Signals) <span class="Emphasis">Display Signal Subscriptions Tab in Causal Manager?</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Weather Signals </h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Weather Signals</span> blade displays segments that the customer is subscribed to. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Causals/Weather Signals blade.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Selecting a segment in the left grid displays the markets available to it in the right grid. Checking or unchecking the <span class="Emphasis">Create Causal</span> check box determines whether Causals for the segments and markets are created in response to the incoming data.</p>
        <p>Checking or unchecking <span class="Emphasis">Create Causal</span> in the segment grid automatically selects all the segment’s available markets. Then you can choose to unselect those markets for which you do not want Causals to be created.</p>
        <p>The bottom graph displays the 14 day outward trend for the selected segment and market.</p>
        <h4>Accessing the Weather Signals blade</h4>
        <p>The following are required to be able to view or edit this blade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Right (Right Group: External Signals) <span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to Weather Signals</span></p>
            </li>

                <p>Right (Right Group: External Signals) <span class="Emphasis">Allow Editing of Weather Signals</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>System policy (Module: External Signals) <span class="Emphasis">Display Weather Signals Tab in Causal Manager?</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Planalytics Variant Segment Link</h4>
        <p>A new view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Planalytics Variant Segment Link</span> lets you link Variants to Subscribed Segments. This new view can be added to Causal Manager and Variant Manager screens.</p>
        <p>You select a Variant Filter that populates the grid once you click <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span>. You can then add or update the Segment using the dropdown in the Segment field. Only subscribed segments display and a segment cannot be removed once added.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Causals only affect the Variants that are assigned to a segment. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Causals/Planalytics Variant Segment Link blade.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The segments that display when selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Segment</span> field are those assigned to you. The Segment data is provided by Planalytics.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Planalytics Variant Segment Link</span> blade can be added to the Causal Manager screen and the Details section of the Variant Manager screens. </p>
        <h4>Choosing External Signals related columns</h4>
        <p class="p">A new meta data group labeled <span class="Emphasis">External Signal</span> has been added to the Variant Manager, Variant Site Manager, Site Manager, and Inventory Manager screens. The fields are read-only.</p>

            <h3><a name="2021.1CAU"></a>2021.1</h3>
        </h3>
        <p>Within ToolsGroup JustEnough, we saw the opportunity to greatly improve the user experience for building and managing causals. This was achieved in two ways: First, revamping the <span class="Emphasis">Causals</span> module into the <span class="Emphasis">Causal Manager</span> module and improving the user workflow. Second, expanding causals into filters as an entity type.
</p>
        <p>

The <span class="Emphasis">Causals</span> module has now been replaced by the <span class="Emphasis">Causal Manager</span> module. Causal Manager mirrors a lot of the Inventory Manager functionality to establish both flexibility and consistency. Users can:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
    create new causals, edit and delete causals, and now have the ability to clone existing causals.
</li>
            <li>    dock causal manager documents next to one another for a side-by-side comparison.
    </li>
            <li>configure a variety of components within <span class="Emphasis">Causal Manager</span>, such as column selections, time series, save layouts, and even bring in additional views.
</li>
            <li>    work between <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Manager</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Causal Manager</span>, with the ability to add or remove multiple causals at a time and have the forecast viewer update in real time.

</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Causal filterable entity type

</h4>
        <p>The user experience for causals has now been expanded into filters as well. Users can now select Causal as a filterable entity type. If a user creates a new filter and moves to the bottom of the dropdown selection, they will see that there is now a Causal filter entity type. Within the Causal filter entity type, users can filter based on a variety of causal-specific metadata in addition to already available metadata such as item and site.

</p>
        <p>Users can use these causal-specific filters for creating Causal Manager documents and views.</p>

        <h4>New weekly maintenance procedure for existing curves</h4>
        <p>With Curves now being utilized by the Rate of Sale blade, there is now a new weekly maintenance procedure which recalculates the existing curves created by users without automatically creating new curves.</p>
        <p>Configuration will be different depending on the size of buckets. Weekly or monthly buckets are recommended.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.3CU"></a>2020.3</h3>
        <h4>Generating curve sets</h4>
        <p>Users now have a more automated, “intelligent” way of selecting and assigning seasonal sales curves for specific SKU-locations. ToolsGroup JustEnough is now able to better utilize existing data to assist with selection and assignment of seasonal curves using a new tab labeled <span class="BodyWord">AI Curve Sets</span>. Users can now generate several curves within a curve set, then assign relative curves to applicable inventories based on how those specific clusters line up.</p>
        <p>What Curve Sets do is analyze historic sales data defined by specified parameters. Curve Sets are generated based on the level forecast hierarchy as specified in the system policy. For the AI curve sets, the level forecast hierarchy is a read-only value and cannot be edited.</p>
        <h2>Customer Account Manager</h2>
        <h3><a name="2021.1CUAM"></a>2021.1</h3>
        <p>The new Customer Account Manager module located within the Management tab gives account managers the ability to view and maintain critical base information related to their accounts ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is available in the wholesale planning process. Wholesale planners can better inform the wholesale planning process by building and viewing reports related to their accounts.</p>

        <h3><a name="2021.1FOC"></a>2021.1</h3>
        <h4>Including a ROS based forecasting method in forecasting tournaments</h4>
        <p>A rate of sale based forecasting method has been added to the list of base methods for configuration. This allows demand planners to include the method in their forecasting tournaments.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.4FOC"></a>2020.4</h3>
        <h4>Forecast Level Optimization</h4>
        <p>Forecast Level Optimization is a new tool designed to help users optimize the accuracy of their forecasts. This is valuable for demand planners who have highly intermittent, short life cycle sales patterns. The purpose of this tool is to generate and automatically test a variety of leveling schemes, and to select the one that produces the most accurate inventory-level forecasts. Forecasting such series manually can be very inaccurate and difficult. To combat this problem, level optimization groups inventories into levels based on a hierarchy. These levels ideally have consistent sale behavior and therefore, can be forecasted accurately. Level forecasts are then split down to inventory.</p>
        <p>There are certain requirements needed in order to successfully run the forecast level optimization. Users should work with their ToolsGroup JustEnough representative to properly configure their database instances, and ensure the correct inputs are set up for accurate results.</p>

        <p>A new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Purchase Order Number</span> provides an easy way to determine if you are sourcing from a purchase order (PO)&#160;at a distribution center or sourcing from the distribution center itself. If the source is a PO, then the field is populated with the purchase order number for the order line.</p>

        <p>Previously, existing order lines gave no indication if an order constraint could not be met. A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Constrained Status</span> has been added to inventory orders. This metric allows users to quickly identify those orders that did not meet a constraint. There are three possible statuses based on applied constraints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Failure</li>
            <li>No Constraint</li>

        <h4>Specifying how Commitment lines should be grouped in Commitment Order documents</h4>
        <p>New functionality lets you specify how Commitment lines should be grouped in Order documents. This functionality is enabled if new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Allow custom grouping of Placeholder Commitment Lines</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>.</p>
        <p>Within the Order Manager module when creating new Commitment orders, a new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Group By</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Add Assortment Plan Order</span> window. This field displays a default grouping. </p>
        <p>Within the Assortment Planning module, the following dialog displays if you click: </p>

        <h4>Combining order lines to consolidate duplicate lines and reduce processing effort</h4>
        <p>Previously, when you selected the option of <span class="Emphasis">This Weeks Orders</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Future Recommended Orders</span> (From Strategy, Redistribution), the system retrieved multiple order lines by delivery date for the same style/color/size/site/source site. Often the duplicate lines had very small recommended order units. Processing such multiple small orders resulted in increased effort for both DC and stores. A new macro option in Order Manager labeled <span class="Emphasis">Combine Order Lines</span> consolidates duplicate lines into the earliest delivery dates per source site and reduces processing effort needed for both DC and stores.</p>
        <p>Whether zero order lines should be preserved is determined by the new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Macro:CombineOrderLines - Preserve Zero Lines</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">External supplier orders and prepack orders will not be combined.</p>
        <h4>Visibility to sales data
		</h4>
        <p>For more information on new columns added to Inventory Manager and Order Manager that provide visibility to sales data, see Inventory Manager.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a new view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sales History by Type - Validation</span> can be added to Order Manager. For more information, see Views.</p>
        <h4>Ensuring changes to Order Quantity do not exceed quantity of units available for distribution in the DC</h4>
        <p>A new Over Consumption alert eliminates the risk of an order being rejected due to the quantity exceeding available units for distribution in the DC. Order quantities are summed up at a SKU-size-source level and the sum is checked against the available quantity (SOH-stock pending) to see if it exceeds the quantity in the DC. This ensures changes made to User Order Quantity do not exceed quantity of units available for distribution in the DC. </p>
        <p>To take advantage of this functionality, select the new check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Enable Overconsumption Check</span> which has been added to the Add Order wizard. Users can review the totals in two new fields added to the Order Document: <span class="Emphasis">Source Rec Order Qty</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Source Remaining Inc Rec Order Qty</span>. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Overconsumption Check</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">Yes</span>, then the check box is selected by default. Users who have been assigned the new User Right <span class="Emphasis">Allows override of Overconsumption check</span> can enable or disable the Over Consumption check at the Order Document Level.</p>
        <p class="p">A new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Overconsumption Check Passed</span> has a check box that indicates whether a row passed the check.</p>
        <h4>Order Types not supported by this feature:</h4>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Allocate</span>: From Stock, From Order, From Scenario</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Assortment</span>: Commitment</p>
        <h4>Improved accuracy of imported replenishment orders </h4>
        <p>The accuracy of imported replenishment orders has been improved. As of v2021.1, you can prevent Replenishment order lines from being automatically authorized for stores that have no received inventory or Supplier Order imports for that day.</p>
        <h4>Automatically checking for valid orders</h4>
        <p>A new Inventory Policy  at the Inventory level has been added to the Policy module. Within the Policy tab, a new <span class="Emphasis">Auto Authorization</span> section with a check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Enable Auto Authorized Order Check</span> allows for automatic checks to be done on the inventory.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The default for new inventory can also be set using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Policy Default: Enable Auto Authorized Order Check</span>.</p>
        <h4>Performing a data validation check</h4>
        <p>A new check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Enable Data Validation Check</span> has been added to the Order Manager header level:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Add Reconsolidation Order Window.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>If selected, a check is performed when an Order is Pre-Authorized or Authorized. If a single Inventory fails the check, then the order does not proceed to the next state.</p>
        <p class="p">A new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Data Validation Check Passed</span> has a check box that indicates whether a row passed the check.</p>
        <h4>Authorizing orders that failed the data validation check</h4>
        <p>A new macro labeled <span class="Emphasis">Auto Authorize Order</span> automatically authorizes orders when lines fail the data validation check. These lines are moved to a new order header named<span class="Emphasis"> [Existing Order Header Name]-Failed Data Validation</span>.</p>
        <h4>Related system policies</h4>
        <p>This new functionality is controlled by the following new system policies:

        <p>In Order Manager documents generated from Assortment Planning, Break by Size partitions by the cluster set/cluster. However, there may be a need to further striate this data by additional geographical information. A new field labeled <span class="BodyWord">Partition Option</span> has been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Break By Size</span> tab which lets users choose additional partitioning metadata by which break by size can be further broken down.

        <p class="BasicNote">This is not a default column, so users who want it displayed will have to include it in the view.</p>
        <p>Users can also access the Inventory Forecast via the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Viewer</span> blade at the bottom of the screen, where they can verify and review forecasts. If a user clicks the <span class="Emphasis">Reviewed</span> button, they can see the review dates when they go back to the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> blade in Variant Manager.</p>
        <p>When users update the <span class="Emphasis">ROS Override</span> value in Variant Manager, the ROS values in the Inventory Manager view will be aggregated into the total sum of the Rate of Sale column.</p>
        <h4>Method Sets - Rate of Sale method selection</h4>
        <p>When users go into the Inventory Forecast module, they can select method sets applicable to their specific inventory forecast. Rate of Sale has been added as a Method Set option, which can be seen when users open up the method set pop-up window.</p>
        <h4>Additional notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Method set definitions cannot be changed in this module and require a user with elevated permissions to add/modify/remove method sets.</p>

        <h4>Visibility to sales data
</h4>
        <p>New columns added to Inventory Manager and Order Manager provide visibility to Last Day Sale units for each style color size and the sum of Last 7 Rolling Days Sales units for each style color size. These new columns help ensure the right number of units are shipped.

</p>
        <p>The new columns can be selected from the new metadata group <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Sales History Information</span>. The columns are:

        <h4>Changing Policy Types</h4>
        <p>You can update the Order Policy Type for multiple items using the <span class="Emphasis">Type</span> column in the top grid in Inventory Manager. Previously, even if you failed to select the <span class="Emphasis">Allow Item's Replenishment Strategy To Be User Controlled</span> check box on the <span class="Emphasis">Policy Information</span> blade, you could change the <span class="Emphasis">Type</span> and click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>. However, failing to select the check box meant that the changes were reversed after inventory policy tasks were executed.</p>
        <p>For v2021.3, If the check box has not been selected, then a message displays and updates are prevented.</p>
        <p>If the <span class="Emphasis">Allow Item's Replenishment Strategy To Be User Controlled</span> check box is checked and you change the <span class="Emphasis">Type</span> to <span class="Emphasis">Bin [B]</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Showroom [S]</span>, then default Bin Min and Bin Max values are set, and a Demand Transference Method added.</p>
        <h4>Defaults</h4>
        <p>If Bin Max has a value, but it is less than Bin Min, it will be set to be equal to Bin Min. By default, Bin Min = 0.</p>
        <p>The Showroom Demand Transference Method default is Split Factor.</p>

        <h4>Performing multiple changes to cells simultaneously</h4>
        <p>Functionality to change multiple cells simultaneously has been implemented in the Rate of Sale module. The new functionality supports multiple changes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Grade</p>

        <h3><a name="2021.1ROS"></a>2021.1</h3>
        <h4>Creating ROS scenarios based on Variants</h4>
        <p>You can create a ROS scenario that is based on a Variant by clicking in the <span class="Emphasis">Scenario Mode</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Scenario</span> grid and selecting <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span>. Once the scenario is set up, users can click the <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> button and view the Scenario Results.</p>
        <p>Users can select the Rate of Sales value they want based on the different Rate of Sales calculations, then apply the Rate of Sale to the selected Variants in the bottom blade. Once ROS values are selected for specific variants, users can go into the Variant Manager module to further edit or update these values.</p>
        <p>A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Locked</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Apply Rate of Sale</span> section that lets you lock the rate of sale at the Variant level. When locked, the rate of sale cannot be overridden but still displays. If <span class="Emphasis">Locked</span> is selected, then the check box in the <span class="Emphasis">Selected</span> column is removed preventing the Variant from being selected. </p>
        <h3><a name="2020.111"></a>2020.1</h3>
        <h4>Setting the ROS Level</h4>
        <p>A new option allows users to set the ROS Level to Inventory or Variant. If set to Inventory, then the Record Count includes inventory at the size level. If set to Variant, then the Record Count includes the number of weeks at the variant level.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.17"></a>2019.1</h3>
        <p>The Rate of Sale (ROS) calculator has been enhanced as follows:</p>
        <h4>Raw and Adjusted ROS calculations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Seasonality is removed.</li>
            <li>Many ROS policies in system policy have been removed.</li>
            <li>Adjusted ROS is affected by all columns.</li>
            <li>Raw ROS is affected by columns: Scenario Mode, AP, Product Filter, Site Filter, Scenario Type, Cluster Set, and Time Frame.</li>
            <li>Adjusted ROS now considers sites with different currencies by converting all sales to the currency defined in System Policy &gt; ROS &gt; Currency. Currency will be converted in terms of currency conversion temporal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Supersession</h2>

        <h4>Enhanced purging of Events

</h4>
        <p>The purging of Events has been enhanced for v2021.1.

</p>
        <p>For more information, contact Mi9 Services and Support to request the <span class="Emphasis">ToolsGroup JustEnough Events Purge User Guide v1.0.0.0</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.112"></a>2020.1</h3>
        <p>The Campaign List has been modified to improve performance.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.26"></a>2019.2</h3>
        <h4>Events with a Promotion marked as Private</h4>
        <p>Promotions can now be marked as Private, Shared, or Public. This gives Promotion owners the ability to hide and protect sensitive content by marking particular promotions as Private or Shared (with only particular users). A logged in user will be able to view Promotions, in the Event module, that are marked Public or are shared with the logged in user.</p>
        <p>A private or unshared Promotion will not be seen in the Available Promotion panes and is masked if used in an Event to hide its specific details as well as to make clear that a Slot is assigned to a Promotion. This masking applies to the Event List, Layout and Version screens but will not affect the Version Report. </p>
        <p>Promotions that are not shared with the logged in user are masked as follows: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Events/Masked unshared promotion.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <h4>Previewing private Promotions owned by another user</h4>
        <p>Whether in the Event List or Layout view, previewing a private Promotion owned by another user  is restricted to only those users with whom  the Promotion is shared. The Promotion preview pane masks the details for a private Promotion that has not been shared with a user who double-clicks on the private Promotion.</p>
        <h4>Restrictions on modifying private Promotions owned by another user</h4>
        <p>For promotions owned by another user that are private to the logged in user, the logged in user cannot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>delete Event Slot Sets which have at least one Promotion that has not been shared with the logged in user. </li>
            <li>modify the Slot Set Template as it may cause the private Promotion to be removed from the Slot Set (i.e. page)</li>
            <li>
                <p> remove or unassign private Promotions</p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b>&#160;For Promotions that are private to the logged in user, the logged in user may still select <b>Remove All</b> on the Promotion menu. However, <b>Remove All</b> will only be applied to Promotions that the logged in user has access to. Promotions that are private to the logged in user are not removed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>merge or split Slots with private Promotions or where private Promotions are adjacent and would be affected</p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> In Layout Edit mode, Promotions that are private to the logged in user cannot be split or merged. Promotions that are adjacent to a private Promotion cannot be merged to the private Promotion. </p>
                <p>For a public Promotion adjacent to a private Promotion, the purple line does not appear when the public Promotion is selected and the public Promotion cannot be merged. Also, logged in users cannot split a Promotion that is private to them.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cloning an Event with Promotions </h4>
        <p>A Promotion’s privacy options can be retained when cloning an Event that has Promotions to maintain privacy for other vehicle types or time frames. In the Clone Event dialog, select the Include Promotions check box to keep the Promotion Privacy options including the shared list of Users and Roles.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.18"></a>2019.1</h3>
        <h4>Slot Set Layout Header</h4>
        <p>The Space name has been added to the Slot Header. Also, hover text is now available if the slot is too small to show the entire header.</p>
        <h4>Item Display Format Restrictions</h4>
        <p>The available Item Display Formats for a specific template can now be restricted. A new dropdown in the Slot Set Template configuration UI has been added to indicate when a template is used in an Event a user can only see the appropriate Item Display Formats. By default, all Item Display Formats are available for all slot set templates.</p>
        <h2>Price and Markdown</h2>
        <h3><a name="2021.4PM"></a>2021.4</h3>
        <h4>Viewing prices and costs in local currency </h4>
        <p>A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">New Price (currencysymbol)</span> has been added to the Variant Site grid on the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab. This new column provides a quick and easy way to review prices and costs in local currency.</p>
        <h4>Submitting variants in configurations multiple times</h4>
        <p>Users can submit a price change and then decide to delete the resulting Price Action before it is committed. Previously, Variants marked as submitted could not be modified and re-submitted. To improve the user experience, this functionality has been enhanced to allow Variants in configurations to be submitted multiple times.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Rules against duplicate price actions are still in place and the onus is on configured validations to catch variant price changes in multiple Price Actions for the same date range.</p>
        <h4>Recalculating new prices based on a new percent off </h4>
        <p class="p">New functionality on the Planning tab lets you recalculate new prices after you manually key in a new percent off for a Variant Site. Select the new <span class="Emphasis">Refresh Pricing</span> button on the toolbar to recalculate new prices based on the keyed in value. Refreshing the pricing does not overwrite any user keyed values.</p>
        <h4>Selecting the most recent Variant Price for the specified StartDate regardless of Price Type</h4>
        <p>A new option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> has been added to the dropdown menu in the <span class="Emphasis">Base Price Type</span> field on the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab for Variant-Site plans. Selecting <span class="Emphasis">Current</span> allows you to select the most recent Variant Price for the specified StartDate regardless of Price Type.</p>
        <p>This new functionality required the following existing system policies to be modified. The<span class="Emphasis"> Current</span> option only displays if <span class="Emphasis">-1</span> is specified in the system policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allowed New Site Pricing Price Types</li>
            <li>Allowed Price Planner Price Types</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The system policies revised descriptions now read:</p>
        <p>Comma Delimited List of Allowed Price Type IDs for New Site Pricing. Standard PriceTypes: 1 = Regular, 2 = Promo, 3 = Markdown, 4 = MSRP, -1 Current  (Current Active Price Regardless of Price Type). Example: 1,2,3. No value means all price types are allowed.</p>
        <h4>Enhanced purging of Price Plans and Price Actions</h4>
        <p class="p">The purging of Price Plans and Price Actions has been enhanced for v2021.4. For more information, contact ToolsGroup Professional Services or Support to request the following:</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>Limiting the Price Types available for selection in the Planning tab</h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Price Planner Price Types</span> (Module: Price Planning) can be used to limit the Price Types available for selection in the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This system policy can be used in conjunction with system policy <span class="Emphasis">Allowed New Site Pricing Price Types</span> (Module: Price Planning).</p>
        <h4>Viewing all Sites and metadata related to a Variant in the Planner tab</h4>
        <p>A check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Show All Sites</span> has been added to the parameters section of the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab. When selected, the Sites grid displays all Sites within the Plan and related metadata.  This allows users to view all Sites and metadata related to a Variant regardless of the filter selected.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing the source of a Price Action</h4>
        <p>New functionality lets Merchants indicate that an "End of Season" date associated to Sites takes precedence over the set Start Date for a Price Action.</p>
        <p>A new metadata labeled <span class="Emphasis">Season Time Frame</span> can be set in the Site Manager module to define an End of Season date that takes precedence over the Start Date. To display the <span class="Emphasis">Season Time Frame</span> column, navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Site</span> tab in the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> grid and use the Choose Fields functionality to select <span class="Emphasis">Season Time Frame</span> from the <span class="Emphasis">Time Frames</span> group.</p>
        <p>This requires a time frame be defined in the <span class="Emphasis">Timeframes</span> module and values be set via Site metadata in Site Manager.</p>
        <p>A new metadata labeled <span class="Emphasis">Season Time Frame</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab. This metric is used to define an End of Season date. To display the Season Time Frame column, use the Choose Fields functionality to select <span class="Emphasis">Season Time Frame</span> from the <span class="Emphasis">Time Frames</span> group.</p>
        <p>When creating Price Actions in the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab, select the new check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use EoS</span> which sets the Price Action to use the “End of Season” time frame where applicable.</p>
        <p>A new column has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab that shows the resolved End Of Season date, this is the date that will be used when creating a price action through the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab if <span class="Emphasis">Use EoS</span> is checked.</p>
        <h4>Using Auto Pricing to automatically create Price Actions</h4>
        <p class="p">As of v2021.2, Pricing Plans can be configured to allow for the automatic creation of Price Actions using Prices imported through standard import.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Automatic Pricing is only available for Variant-Site plans.</p>
        <h4>Configuring new Plans to allow automatic pricing</h4>
        <p class="p">To configure a Pricing Plan to allow automatic pricing, select the new <span class="Emphasis">Allow Auto Price</span> check box when creating the Plan. </p>

        <p class="BasicNote">If <span class="Emphasis">Allow Auto Price</span> is unchecked, then the Auto Pricing Price Action creation procedure ignores the Plan and the <span class="Emphasis">Auto Price Settings</span> section does not display.</p>
        <p>You can at any time set a Plan to allow or not allow Auto Pricing. </p>
        <p>To view and edit Plan Auto Pricing Configuration parameters, you require the following new User Rights (Right Group: Price Manager):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to Plan Auto Price Configuration</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to Plan Price Reversion</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Viewing and editing a Plan’s Auto Pricing parameters</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Information</span> tab’s UI has been reconfigured to display an <span class="Emphasis">Auto Price Settings</span> section in which you can review and edit the automatic pricing parameters.</p>
        <h4>Using a procedure to automatically scan Price Items</h4>
        <p>For Plans where the <span class="Emphasis">Allow Auto Price</span> check box has been selected (Auto Pricing enabled), price items in those Plans can be scanned, identified, and priced automatically at regular intervals. The Auto Price process is controlled by  a new procedure which can be configured in Job Manager as a recurring job.</p>
        <h4>Auto Pricing Configuration</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>

        <h4>Reviewing Variant data at the Variant-Site level</h4>
        <p>Within the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> section of the <span class="Emphasis">Actions</span> tab, the Filter Entity Type for the <span class="Emphasis">Variants</span> grid has been modified to be Variant-Site.</p>
        <h4>Applying price reversions from within Pricing Plans</h4>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough v2021.2 introduces the ability to apply price reversions from within Pricing Plans using a new <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion</span> tab. By navigating to the <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion</span> tab located between a Pricing Plan’s <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Actions</span> tabs, you can select a price reversion type and the effective date of the reversion for a series of Variant-Sites. </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion</span> tab is only available for Variant-Site plans.
		</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Price Action logic separates price actions by Effective Date (PA Start Date), Channel, and Reversion Type ID (Price Method, Workflow, Source Type).

        </p>
        <div class="Note_BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion</span> tab is only visible if:
		<ul><li>system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion Tab Visibility</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span></li><li>the user has been assigned User Rights: <ul><li><span class="Emphasis">Add Price Action</span></li></ul><ul><li><span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to Plan Price Reversion</span></li></ul></li></ul></div>
        <h4>Default and additional grid columns</h4>
        <p class="p">In addition to columns that display data relating to Variants and Sites, the following Pricing columns display by default:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Previous Price Type - Based on Source Price Type in Reversion Type</li>
            <li>Previous Price Date</li>
            <li>Previous Price</li>
            <li>Current Price Type</li>
            <li>Current Price Date</li>
            <li>Current Price</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Additional price types may be displayed as columns within the grid. These additional price types are defined using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion UI Displayed Price Types</span>.</p>
        <h4>Price reversion types </h4>
        <p>System Administrators can use the <span class="Emphasis">Reversion Types</span> tab which has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Price Manager Configuration</span> screen to configure Reversion Type profiles. These profiles are then used to create Price Actions that revert prices to a previous state. Selecting the type during the Price Reversion process determines the Price Strategy, Workflow, and the Price Type used to populate the System Input variable in the Reversion Price Action.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">The Price Types are limited by a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Price Reversion Allowed Price Types</span>.</p>
        <h4>Accessing the Planning tab</h4>
        <p class="p">Previously, users who were assigned User Right <span class="Emphasis">Add Price Action</span> could access the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab but not submit. As of ToolsGroup JustEnough v2021.2, the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab is hidden if the user has not been assigned <span class="Emphasis">Add Price Action</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab is only available for Variant-Site plans.

        <h3><a name="2021.1PM"></a>2021.1</h3>
        <h4>Creating price actions within Variant by Site plans </h4>
        <p>A new <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab has been added between the Price Action <span class="Emphasis">Information</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Actions</span> tabs. Using the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab, you can filter the variants in a Plan using dozens of metrics to determine which variants / variant sites are prime candidates for markdowns, and quickly setup the price actions needed to execute them. The <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab provides visibility to what the price is at a future date, stock on hand, sales, revenue, etc.</p>
        <p>Just set the dates you want to plan for, and strategy you want to implement, and review all the variants in the plan, or use available <span class="Emphasis">Variant Site Filter</span> to intelligently identify variants in the plan based on filter metadata.  You then review the data and apply markdowns by entering a percentage or directly input a new price at the variant or the variant site level. You can then choose to save the plan, and return to apply further markdowns at a later date, or submit the plan to commit the changes and generate the needed price actions.</p>
        <p>Another new feature for Price and Markdown is the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tool incorporated into Site Manager.  This interface allows you to select a new site and copy pricing from a similar site.  From Site Manager you select the site that is to be priced, the model site to copy pricing from, and the price type to be copied.  Pricing can be reviewed then submitted to generate needed price actions in a designated plan.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> tab is only available for Variant Site Plans.</p>
        <h4>Specifying default workflows for Price Actions</h4>
        <p>You can now specify the default workflow for Price Actions created through the UI or other automated methods using the new <span class="Emphasis">Default Workflows</span> configuration screen.</p>
        <h4>Configuring variables with a Price Type of MSRP</h4>
        <p>A new Price Type labeled <span class="Emphasis">MSRP</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Input Price / Cost Field</span> column in the <span class="Emphasis">Price Variables</span> tab in the Price Manager Configuration view. <span class="Emphasis">MSRP</span> is an available option when Input Type is <span class="Emphasis">Price</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Price Variables</span> tab is used to define parameters (system derived as well as configurable by you) which are used in calculations and can be configured for export.</p>
        <h4>Improved Price Planner garbage collection</h4>
        <p>Price Planner garbage collection has been improved through a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Price Planner Configuration: stale for N days before deletion occurs</span>. For more information, see System Policies.</p>

        <h4>Price Manager labels migrating to Language Translated functionality </h4>
        <p>Work is continuing on migrating Price Manager's hard coded labels to Language Translated functionality. As of v2020.3, many Price Manager labels can be modified using language translation.</p>
        <h4>Defining Sites by currency and country </h4>
        <p>In the Sites grid on a Pricing Plan’s <span class="Emphasis">Information</span> tab, Sites are now broken out by currency and country. Added Sites are assigned to an existing Cluster with the same Country and Currency. If no matching Clusters exist, a new one is created. A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Country Name</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Sites</span> grid.</p>
        <h4>Using approved Price Points across multiple currency and country combinations</h4>
        <p>The Pricing module has been enhanced to allow for using approved Price Points across multiple currency and country combinations for both Item\Site and Variant\Site Price Actions.</p>
        <p>As part of this enhancement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new system policy labeled <span class="BodyWord">Default Pricing Plan Price Matrix Usage</span> lets users set the default for whether new Price Manager Plans will default to allow or not allow Price Actions to use a Price Matrix for rounding.</li>
            <li>A new configuration view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Price Manager Configuration</span> view. As of v2020.4, Price matrixes can be imported into ToolsGroup JustEnough, configured for use within Price Manager, and assigned to Price Plans and Price Actions. </li>
            <li>A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use Price Matrix</span> has been added to the Variable grid in the <span class="Emphasis">Price Strategies</span> configuration view to allow variables to be flagged for Price Matrix Translation and Rounding.</li>
            <li>To support verification of calculations that should use a price matrix and need to be validated, a new check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use Matrix</span> has been  added to the <span class="Emphasis">Price Calculations</span> configuration view.</li>
            <li>A check box labeled <span class="Emphasis">Allow Price Matrix</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Create New Plan</span> and Price Plan edit screen that allows you to set Pricing Plans to allow Price Point conversions through a Price Matrix. </li>
            <li>You can apply a Price Matrix to all the Clusters in a Price Action. To apply a Price Matrix, select the check box in the <span class="Emphasis">Apply Matrix To All</span> field.</li>
            <li>A new metadata group labeled <span class="Emphasis">Price</span> has been added to Site Manager, Inventory Manager, and Variant Site Manager. The <span class="Emphasis">Price</span> metadata group includes <span class="Emphasis">Min Discount</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Use Full Price</span>.

        <h4>Editing Price Action custom header variables </h4>
        <p>Users can create custom Price Action Header variables including custom date fields that can be configured for use with price and cost variables in place of the Price Action Start Date. To create these variables, navigate to the <span class="Emphasis">Price Header Variables</span> tab within the <span class="Emphasis">Price Manager Configuration</span> screen.</p>
        <h4>Price Manager labels migrating to Language Translated functionality </h4>
        <p>Price Manager's hard coded labels are being migrated to Language Translated functionality. As of v2020.3, many Price Manager labels can be modified using language translation.</p>
        <h4>Simplified plan management through UI improvements</h4>
        <p>The Price Manager module has undergone a significant UI overhaul to simplify and expedite price plan management. UI improvements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the replacement of separate tabs on the <span class="BodyWord">Home</span> screen toolbar with a dropdown field labeled<span class="BodyWord"> Plan Selection</span> that allows you to select just your plans or all plans.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the replacement of the <span class="BodyWord">Include</span> and <span class="BodyWord">Exclude</span> buttons within the <span class="BodyWord">Sites</span> grid in the <span class="BodyWord">Information</span> screen with a check box field labeled <span class="BodyWord">Inactive</span> and a <span class="BodyWord">Save</span> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>the refinement of prompts and messaging in the <span class="BodyWord">Variants</span> grid in the <span class="BodyWord">Information</span> screen.</li>
            <li>reorganizing the <span class="BodyWord">Actions</span> tab to display price actions where only changes to the price action header can be made and adding a new button labeled <span class="BodyWord">Open</span> which opens the selected price action in a new tab for more extensive editing.</li>
            <li>the separation of Validation Severity and Calculation status into separate columns in the <span class="BodyWord">Plan</span>, <span class="BodyWord">Price Action</span>, <span class="BodyWord">Cluster</span>, and Variant grids.</li>
            <li>
                <p>the ability to exclude or re-include Sites from a Plan in the <span class="BodyWord">Sites</span> pane on the Pricing Plan’s <span class="BodyWord">Information</span> tab. (This does not change existing Price Actions. However, new Price Actions will have the Sites excluded or re-included.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>significantly improved performance by having changes at the:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Cluster level not save down to the Variant or Variant Details Data tables (changes to the Cluster level no longer push down to lower levels).</li>
                    <li>Variant level not save down to the Variant Details Data tables (changes to the Variant level no longer push down to lower levels).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the ability to update multiple Clusters simultaneously where before users had to change and save each cluster separately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>API Export Price Action template updated</h4>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">API Export Price Action</span> template has been updated to support variant\site level configuration.</p>
        <h4>Limiting who can run Price Action Level Calculations</h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="BodyWord">Disable Action Level Calculate</span> lets system administrators disable the <span class="BodyWord">Calculate</span> button at the Price Action level and only allow activation of the Calculate button at the Cluster grid level. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.113"></a>2020.1</h3>
        <h4>Editing Price Action custom header variables</h4>
        <p>Users can create custom Price Action Header variables including custom date fields that can be configured for use with price and cost variables in place of the Price Action Start Date. To create these variables, navigate to the <span class="BodyWord">Price Header Variables</span> tab within the Price Manager Configuration screen.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.48"></a>2019.4</h3>
        <h4>Price Action support for Variant-Site level pricing </h4>
        <p> Price Manager can now be configured to allow the creation of Plans that work either at the Item-Site level or a new Variant-Site level.  The Variant-Site level is useful for when pricing exceptions are not needed for variants at the size (Item Master) level.   The functionality between the two options is identical except at the detail level  (see below).</p>
        <p>Performance is improved when executing calculations and validations at a Variant-Site level compared to the Item-Site level due to Variant-Site Price Actions having much smaller data sets.</p>
        <p class="note">The <b>Advanced Exclusion</b> menu option in the <b>Action Summary</b> grid is not available when the Pricing Plan is configured for Variant-Site pricing only. </p>
        <h4>Managing an individual Site’s Variant pricing</h4>
        <p>Within a Site Cluster, an individual Site's Variant pricing can be viewed to better understand any high and low's indicated at the Variant summary level as well as to evaluate the Site level data to decide if a pricing override should occur for a specific Site.</p>
        <p>To view an individual site's Variant cost and price information and to create pricing exceptions at the Variant's Site level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>click the <b>Detail</b> field in the <b>Action Summary</b> grid to display the <b>Variant Details</b> dialog:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <h4>Validation log</h4>
        <p>The Validation log supports a Variant-Site configuration. </p>
        <p class="note">If a pricing plan’s Product Pricing Level is set to <b>Variant-Site Plan</b>, then system policy <b>Advanced Validation Log</b> is ignored and the Advanced Validation log displays regardless. Otherwise, if a plan’s Product Pricing Level is set to <b>Item-Site Plan</b>, then system policy <b>Advanced Validation Log</b> is evaluated and the system displays either the default or advanced validation log.</p>
        <h4>Price Validation Error Handling Mode </h4>
        <p>Price Manager price validation errors may now operate in a mode which either stop or continue the validation based on a system policy selection. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.312"></a>2019.3</h3>
        <p>Within a Pricing Plan, two new menu options have been added to the toolbar of the Sites grid. The options are labeled <b>New Cluster</b> and <b>Add Site</b>. Users now have the ability to create new Site Clusters (that must contain at least one Site) and to include additional Sites in existing Site Clusters. The new Site Clusters and additional sites can be applied to future Price Actions not already exported or in the process of being exported. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Add a cluster to a Pricing Plan.PNG" />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="2019.27"></a>2019.2</h3>
        <h4>Changing multiple Price Action statuses at once</h4>
        <p>As of version 2019.2, you can change the status of multiple Price Actions at once thus avoiding having to open and change the status for each and every Price Action. The changing of multiple statuses at once is effected using a new Multiple Price Action Status dialog. Select Change Status(es) either in the Price Actions grid on the Price Manager screen or within the Pricing Plan’s Action grid. The system will allow the user to review all Pricing Actions, in the grid, that they have rights to transition to the next Status per each Price Action’s specific workflow.</p>
        <h4>Cleaning up historical Price Actions and Plans</h4>
        <p>System administrators can now cleanup historical Price Actions and Plans so that system data size can be maintained. The new SQL stored procedure Pricing Plan and Action Cleanup is run as a Scheduled Task via Job Manager.</p>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">NOTE:</span> This is a breaking change as this new nightly job needs to be configured to the customer data retention policies.</p>
        <h4>Evaluating Price Validation failures at the Variant and Site level</h4>
        <p>You can now evaluate Pricing Validation failures at a Variant and Site level, so that there are fewer records to evaluate. Additionally, there is now the ability to set overrides at the Variant level. To enable this functionality, set the system policy <span class="BodyWord">Advanced Validation Log</span> to True.</p>
        <h3><a name="2019.19"></a>2019.1</h3>
        <h4>Advanced Variant Item Master filtering</h4>
        <p>A new menu option has been added to the Price Action Summary menu to display the Advanced Product Exclusion dialog. The dialog lets users exclude or re-include products at all levels: Variant, Item Master and Inventory.  Multiple selections at a product parent level display the summary of children at the lower levels for modification. No additional User Rights are needed beyond the current ability to 'Edit a Price Action'.</p>
        <h4>Cloning price actions</h4>
        <p>Price actions can now be cloned on the Price Manager Actions screen. Clicking the Clone button lets users quickly create a new price action based on an existing price action. Users require the access to create price actions. All Price Action Strategy values will remain intact while the system evaluates any change to Cost and Price based on the new Price Action Start Date.</p>
        <h4>Price Strategy User\Role Restrictions </h4>
        <p>As of v2019.1, users can be restricted to which price strategies they can use via a new button labeled Edit (User Access column) on the Price Strategies tab on the Price Manager Configuration screen. </p>
        <p>To access the Price Manager Configuration screen, select Influence&#160;&gt; Price and Markdown &gt; Configuration. On the Price Strategies tab, click Edit to display the Remove User Rights screen in which you add or remove user access to particular price strategies.</p>
        <p>Users will only have visibility to those price strategies for which they have access. When creating a new Price Action, the strategies that display in the Price Action Strategy dropdown list on the Create New Price Action screen are filtered based on the user’s access.</p>
        <h4>Validation log </h4>
        <p>New filters have been added to the Validation Log to let users review and mark as reviewed validation failure records allowing Promotions to continue to downstream systems.  Additionally, the Validation Log no longer limits the number of records returned. The new filters are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error Encountered</li>
            <li>Error Overridden</li>
            <li>Warning Found</li>
            <li>Warning Overridden</li>
            <li>Information Provided</li>
            <li>Information Overridden</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can select multiple filters as required.</p>
        <h4>Ability to filter product validation failures</h4>
        <p>As of v2019.1, the system will pre-filter product validation failures based on where you initialize the Validation Log (e.g. Price Action, Price Cluster, Variant, etc.). Additional filtering can then be implemented by the user.</p>
        <h4>Restrictions on special characters removed </h4>
        <p>Prior to v2019.1, users were prevented from including special characters in Pricing Plan or Price Action names. This constraint is now removed.</p>
        <h4>Ability to copy Variant Codes from the Product Grid Control </h4>
        <p>A new right-click option labeled <b>Copy Column Cell(s)</b> lets users copy Variant Codes from the Product Grid Control. This allows for the creation of a new Price Action for only the copied variants. </p>
        <h2>Price Matrix</h2>
        <h3><a name="2020.4PMA"></a>2020.4</h3>
        <p>A new Price Matrix module has been added under the <span class="Emphasis">Influence</span> tab. The <span class="Emphasis">Price Point Matrix</span> view displays a set of pre-approved Price Points across multiple currency and country combinations. </p>

        <h4>Promotion Calculations and Promotion Validation screens
		</h4>
        <p>The Promotion Calculations and Promotion Validation screens have been renamed Calculations and Validations respectively. Importantly, these two screens have undergone significant security enhancements relating to formulas. For more information, refer to the <span class="Emphasis">Building valid SQL statements as formulas while setting up calculations or validations</span> section below.

        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Promotion Columns</span> screen has been relabeled <span class="Emphasis">Promotion Fields</span>. The screen now displays all columns that can be used in a calculation or validation formula. Users can regard the reconfigured screen as a single source of truth that provides an extremely simple way of reviewing the valid columns and their settings for Promotions.</p>

        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Export Maintenance</span> screen no longer displays by default. However, this screen is currently still available under System Utilities &gt; Views.</p>
        <h4>Building valid SQL statements as formulas while setting up calculations or validations </h4>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough v2021.4 introduces new formula verification functionality to the <span class="Emphasis">Calculations</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Validations</span> tabs in the <span class="Emphasis">Promotion Configuration</span> tool. The functionality prevents any building of harmful SQL statements (DROP TABLE, DELETE, etc.) as formulas while setting up calculations or validations.</p>
        <p>Fields used in formulas are now restricted to standard promotion fields and any custom fields defined by the customer, and now need to be enclosed in square brackets within the formula. A list of predefined statements and operators, such as those in mathematical functions, dictates allowed formula construction. If poorly formed or malicious formulas for calculations or validations are submitted through the UI or API, then a message displays indicating that the formula did not meet the standards set in place. Poorly formed or malicious formulas cannot be saved to prevent them from being used in any sort of calculations or validations. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This enhancement results in a Breaking Change. For more information, see Promotions in the Breaking Changes section.</p>
        <h4>Confirming price calculations and validations have been verified </h4>
        <p>You can now easily confirm if a price calculation or validation has been verified. A new column labeled <span class="Emphasis">Is Verified</span> has been added to the Promotion Configuration tabs <span class="Emphasis">Calculations</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Validations</span>. <span class="Emphasis">IsVerified</span> does not apply to Method-based Calculations or Validations.</p>
        <h4>Setting a default value for a Promotion Plan’s Exclude Markdowns check box</h4>

        <h4>Creating promotions based on existing promotions </h4>
        <p>There are two ways to create a promotion based on an existing promotion. A new promotion based on an existing promotion can be made by clicking either the <span class="BodyWord">Save As</span> button or <b>Clone</b> button from the Promotion toolbar.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Creating promotions based on existing promotions.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <h4>Save As versus Clone</h4>
        <p>Selecting <span class="BodyWord">Save As</span> is almost the same as selecting <span class="BodyWord">Clone</span>. Both functions default to the same price cluster set and other details. </p>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">Save As</span> dialog lets you make changes to the promotion header, dates, work flows, and so on. Also, you can change the cluster set and generate a promotion with the same items but different clusters and site assignments. If you choose to keep the current cluster set, then the system retrieves the sites and clusters based on the latest snapshot for the cluster set. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Save as Promotion.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Clone Promotion</b> dialog displays allowing you to make changes to the promotion header, dates, work flows, and so on. However, the <span class="BodyWord">Price Cluster Set</span> field is read-only preventing the cluster set from being changed. The new promotion will have the same clusters, sites, and items as the original promotion.</p>

        <h4>Simplified Promotion implementations </h4>
        <p>A new configuration widget labeled <span class="BodyWord">Promotion Columns</span> in the <span class="BodyWord">Promotion Configuration</span> screen greatly simplifies Promotion implementations. With this widget, Technical Services Consultants can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>configure new columns for Promotion PriceOutput tables while avoiding missing important tables, and</li>
            <li>map multiple Price and Cost types to columns.</li>

        <h4>Defining planned lift factors by cluster set</h4>
        <p>With v2020.1, demand forecasting accuracy can be improved by defining a planned lift factor by cluster set and having those values pushed to the Causals import API. This is achieved by selecting the new button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sync</span> located on the Promotion grid toolbar. Selecting this button displays the <span class="Emphasis">Sync Promotion</span> dialog in which users can enter the override lift value as a percentage. A right-click menu option allows multiple rows to be updated simultaneously.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The user right <span class="Emphasis">Allow access to Sync</span> located in Right Group: Promotions is required to access this functionality.</p>

        <h4>Changing multiple Promotion statuses at once</h4>
        <p>As of version 2019.2, you can change the status of multiple Promotions at once thus avoiding having to open and change the status for each and every Promotion. The changing of multiple statuses at once is effected using a new dialog. </p>
        <p>Selecting the Change Status(es) menu option on the Promotions screen will allow the user to review all Promotions in the grid that they have rights to transition to the next Status per each Promotion’s specific workflow.</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/Promotion Management/Change Statuses menu option.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Marking a Promotion as Private, Public, or Shared </h4>
        <p> v2019.2 introduces new functionality to allow a Promotion owner to now designate a Promotion as Private or Shared thereby restricting visibility and access to that Promotion to particular roles and users. </p>
        <p>The restricted Promotion’s privacy setting can later be changed to Public allowing all users visibility and access once the need for privacy has passed. Additionally, when cloning a Promotion the original privacy setting can be retained or changed on the Clone Promotion dialog. All historic Promotions within the system will be marked as Public with the upgrade.</p>
        <p>This functionality is extended within the Event module restricting the ability to view the Promotions in the Event List and Layout screens as well as within the "Available Promotions" pane. </p>
        <h3><a name="2019.110"></a>2019.1</h3>
        <h4>Validation logs</h4>
        <p>New advanced filtering has been added to the Validation Log to let users review and mark as reviewed validation failure records allowing Promotions to continue to downstream systems. Additionally, the Validation log now returns large record sets. The new filters are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error Encountered</li>
            <li>Error Overridden</li>
            <li>Warning Found</li>
            <li>Warning Overridden</li>
            <li>Information Provided</li>
            <li>Information Overridden</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can select multiple filters as required.</p>
        <h4>Promotion strategy restrictions</h4>
        <p>Users can now be restricted to which promotion strategies they can use via a new button labeled Edit (Edit User Access column) on the Promotion Strategy tab on the Promotion Configuration screen. To access the Promotion Configuration screen, select Influence &gt; Promotion &gt; Configuration. Click Edit to display the Remove User Rights screen in which you add or remove user access to particular promotion strategies.</p>
        <p>Users will only have visibility to those promotion strategies for which they have access. When creating a new promotion, the strategies that display in the Promotion Strategy dropdown list on the Create New Promotion screen are filtered based on the user’s access.</p>
        <h2>Target Choice Count</h2>
        <h2><a name="2021.4TCC"></a>2021.4</h2>
        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span> module is a standalone version of the Target Creation functionality found within Assortment Planning (AP). The main differences between this module and AP is that for the <span class="Emphasis">Target Choice Count</span> module, the settings come from system policies and the entity in use is Variant. For AP, the settings come from the AP plan and the entity in use is Variant Placeholder.</p>
        <p>The main view is read-only. Changes are made by selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Edit</span> button and using the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> screen to make desired changes.</p>

        <p>As of 2019.1, the system will only update modified Content fields when saving changes. This is implemented at all levels (Master, Event, and Content) as well as updating the modifications to the other levels. This modification prevents unchanged fields from overwriting modified content.</p>
        <h2>Engine Template</h2>
        <h3><a name="2019.314"></a>2019.3</h3>
        <p>version 2019.3 introduces a new module called <span class="BodyWord">Engine Template</span> that provides a central source of managing engine templates so that users can easily create and update templates in a single place. There are two default task detail templates that can be used by the Engine to run items requested by the user without requiring any input from the user about the configuration. These templates are configured by editing a <span class="BodyWord">Replenish Task</span> dialog or a <span class="BodyWord">Forecast Task</span> dialog and saving the updated configuration into the template.</p>
        <p>The purpose of these templates is to allow processes that should not require user input to be able to create engine tasks with appropriate predefined settings.</p>
        <p><span class="BodyWord">Engine Template</span> is located under the <span class="BodyWord">Management</span> tab.</p>

        <p>An Engine Performance Report is now mailed for any engine task longer than the time specified in the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Performance Reporting Min Run Inclusion Time</span> (Module: Reporting). The default is 600 seconds.</p>
        <p>The reports include:</p>
        <ul>

        <h3><a name="2020.3EN"></a>2020.3</h3>
        <p>A new API endpoint is now available on all of the engines that can take a sample of the host's current system usage such as Memory% and CPU% every minute (configurable with the node update timer) and store it in the compute manager. This will be consumed when creating reports showing task progress and how each system was being used during the task run.</p>

        <p>Previously, when users were working in the <span class="Emphasis">Navigation</span> tree the entire tree would collapse to the top level whenever a job is executed. To enhance the usability of Job Manager the tree now remains expanded and the focus remains on the Jobs section. Executing jobs now appear in a separate navigation pane.</p>

        <h4>Using continuous rolling time frames with static exclusions</h4>
        <p>Previously, to exclude a sub-set of a time frame (for example, consider the last 3 years but exclude every December) over multiple time frames required configuring  a schedule and then manually excluding each and every single day of that sub-set. So, excluding every December required making a calendar and repeating the exclusion of December 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on. This would result in a calendar with 31 exclusions to exclude all of December in its calculations. </p>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough 2021.4 introduces functionality that significantly enhances the usability of the <span class="Emphasis">Timeframes</span> module around excluding particular time frames. A new section labeled <span class="Emphasis">Time Frame Exclusion</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Time Frame Maintenance</span> view. This new section lets you quickly and easily add static exclusion dates to time frames.</p>
        <h2>Site Clustering</h2>

        <p>New fields added to the <span class="Emphasis">Model Site</span> Select in the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tab provide additional information about the sites to copy pricing from. The fields are:</p>

        <h4>Limiting the Price Types available for selection in the New Site Pricing tab</h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Allowed New Site Pricing Price Types</span> (Module: Price Planning) can be used to limit the Price Types available for selection in the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tab. For more information, see System Policies.</p>
        <div class="Note_BasicNote">This system policy can be used in conjunction with system policy <span class="Emphasis">Allowed Price Planner Price Types</span> (Module: Price Planning).</div>
        <h4>Displaying or hiding the New Site Pricing tab</h4>
        <p>As of v2021.2, the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tab can be either displayed or hidden. The <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tab is visible only if a user has been assigned new User Right <span class="Emphasis">Allow Access to New Site Pricing</span>. However, if new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Show New Site Pricing</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">False</span> (default), then the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tab is hidden regardless of whether the User Right was assigned or not.</p>

        <h4>Selecting new sites and copying pricing from similar sites</h4>
        <p>A new feature for Price and Markdown is the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> tool incorporated into Site Manager.  This interface allows you to select a new site and copy pricing from a similar site.  From Site Manager you select the site that is to be priced, the model site to copy pricing from, and the price type to be copied.  Pricing can be reviewed then submitted to generate needed price actions in a designated plan.

        <h4><a name="Setting"></a>Setting site capacity values </h4>
        <p>Users can enter Site Capacity values within the <span class="Emphasis">Site Capacity Temporal</span> tab within Site Manager by setting a hierarchy level and a time frame (in weeks). These values set by the Site Manager can be displayed in the Allocation Rollup. Having Site Capacity values surfaced in the Allocation Rollup provides more insights for reporting and filtering purposes.
</p>
        <p class="Important">When a user changes Site Capacity Hierarchy, they will need to clear the data manually or be aware they can potentially have values in the wrong place. To properly set Site Capacity values, users will also need to ensure the Hierarchy that is defined by Site Capacity is aligned to the Hierarchy used for Rollup Aggregation.</p>

        <h3><a name="2020.115"></a>2020.1</h3>
        <p>A new module labeled <span class="BodyWord">Variant Customer Manager</span> has been added to the <span class="BodyWord">Management</span> section. This module allows users to create data records which associate variants and the wholesale accounts which purchase them.</p>

        <h4>User Security Rights for the Rate of Sale (ROS) blade</h4>
        <p>User Security Rights have been created for the Rate of Sale (ROS) blade in Variant Manager. This includes a variety of edit and read-only access rights that can be assigned from one user to another. This is especially important for businesses with different levels of users, where some users are regular users that simply manage and view Rate of Sales across different variants and inventories. On the other hand, there are power users or admin users that are in charge of editing and updating several variants based on their demand plan. By having specific user rights available for this blade, it allows for better management of access for each user.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">The User Security Rights can be viewed by navigating to <span class="Emphasis">Maintenance &gt; Users &gt; [Select User] &gt; Rights &gt; Variant Manager</span>.</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the application of Rate of Sales</h4>
        <p>The Rate of Sale functionality in Variant Manager has been enhanced as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Previously, when capturing the data in the variant manager, users needed to save the variant data twice before it applied the method set. For v2021.2, users can save changes in one click avoiding confusion in saving any more than once.</li>
            <li>Validation has been introduced which displays a warning message if users click <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> without having selected all the required parameters.</li>
            <li>A right-click menu option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Select All</span> has been added to the grid in the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale Bulk Copy Form</span> view. This allows users to save significant time copying data over multiple variants.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Correction to a language translation string</h4>
        <p>In Variant Manager, when the results are brought back, the bottom of the section now correctly displays as <span class="Emphasis">Variant X of XX</span> instead of <span class="Emphasis">Site X of XX</span>.</p>
        <h4>Sorting method sets in the ROS blade</h4>
        <p>To enhance the user experience, the ability to sort method sets has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Method Set</span> field in the ROS blade.</p>
        <h3><a name="2021.1VM">2021.1</a>
        </h3>
        <h4>Rate of Sale blade</h4>
        <p>After users create a Variant Manager document, they can select one or more variants from the filter and edit their details in the new <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> blade which can be found at the bottom of the Variant Manager screen. Within the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> blade, users can edit and update several columns, such as phase dates, Rate of Sale override values, curves and product models, and more. Variant-level phase in and out and ROS values can be applied to and passed down to the inventory level.</p>
        <p>Users can also select method sets from the <span class="Emphasis">Method Set</span> dropdown field, which can then be viewed inside the Inventory Forecast module. The same values that users can push down to the inventory level are also available at the level forecast level.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Changes in Variant Manager only impact at the Variant level and inventory forecasting. Changes do not impact level forecasting. </p>

        </p>
        <p>You can select multiple Variants in the top grid and the lower grid displays information for the selections.</p>
        <h4>Bulk Copy functionality</h4>
        <p>Within the Rate of Sale blade, there is Bulk Copy functionality, which allows users to copy over data across multiple variants. This is helpful in saving users time when there are similar variants they want to quickly copy over data for. When using the Bulk Copy pop-out screen, users can select (using the check boxes) which fields they want to copy over to other variants. When using the bottom half of the screen, users must select which variants they want the copied data applied to.</p>

        <h4>Inventory Manager button</h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Manager</span> button allows users to access Inventory Manager as part of the workflow. Once users are done setting up their fields in Variant Manager, they can quickly access Inventory Manager to review their inventory forecasts.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Users must click the <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> button after making changes in the <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> blade.</p>
        <h3><a name="2020.3VM"></a>Enhancements to the Variant Attribute Management blade</h3>
        <p>The <span class="BodyWord">Variant Attribute Management</span> blade has been enhanced to include support for multiple attribute types including boolean, numeric, dates, and strings.</p>
        <h2>Variant Site Manager</h2>
        <h3><a name="Variant"></a>2019.4</h3>
        <p>The new Variant Site Manager module is now available from the Management tab. This new module provides the functionality to select, view, and manage data specific to site variants. The site variant specific data can then be used extensively in the planning functions of ToolsGroup JustEnough.</p>
        <p>Before you manage your site variants, you must assign product attributes to variants through the Variant Manager module.</p>
        <h4>New Variant Site Metadata  </h4>
        <p>Allocators and Demand Planners are now able to filter for new metadata at the variant-site level, which allows them to report on their performance at a more granular level. Having this metadata handy will allow them to actively mitigate potential shortfall situations and reduce lost sales. For details, see <b>Metadata in Variant Site Manager</b> in the online help.</p>
        <p>The following metadata is now available in Filter Groups in the Variant Site Manager Document:</p>

        <h4>Analyzing irregular sales history </h4>
        <p>You can review items with anomalous spikes in sales history using the <span class="BodyWord">Irregular Sales History Analysis</span> screen. Based on recent history, products that are either over-performing, or under-performing,  can be identified using filters in the Irregular Sales Analysis group. The filters are available at the Inventory level.</p>
        <p>The filters are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has Irregular Sales</li>
            <li>Has Underperforming Irregular Sales</li>
            <li>Has Overperforming Irregular Sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can filter irregular items so that you can review the forecasts and potentially apply causals.</p>
        <h4>Accessing the Disaster Sales Modeling screen</h4>
        <p>This screen can be accessed by navigating to System Utilities &gt; Views &gt; Inventory &gt; Irregular Sales History Analysis.</p>
        <h4>Modeling sales data</h4>
        <p>
If  sales are reduced significantly due to a large scale event such as a disaster, you can put in place modeled sales using the <span class="BodyWord">Disaster Sales Modeling</span> screen. You can select a store and have the system calculate relevant theoretical sales history data for this store during the periods impacted by the event.


</p>
        <p>The modeled sales history data for selected stores is based on forecasting methods. The data is modeled on the LY periods for the same store at the same levels of the product hierarchies. This data is entered as a special sales type so that it does not conflate or otherwise interfere with actual sales.</p>
        <h4>Accessing the Disaster Sales Modeling screen</h4>
        <p>This screen can be accessed by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> navigating to System Utilities &gt; Views &gt; Disaster Model &gt; Disaster Sales Modeling</li>
            <li>adding the view to the Site Manager module. </li>
