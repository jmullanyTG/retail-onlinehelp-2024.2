        <h1>ToolsGroup JustEnough New and Improved Functionality by Release</h1>
        <h2><a name="2023.WSPL"></a>Wholesale Planning</h2>
        <p>As the presence of online marketplaces expands, traditional retailers are identifying a need to create plans for these non-traditional sites. This problem statement could begin with a retailer allocating stock (and sales expectations) to be fulfilled by Amazon, or Walmart, or the like; or it could expand into a broader "wholesale" strategy. In order to support this growing need for retailers to plan in the wholesale space, the traditional TG JE retail functionality has been enhanced to better support wholesale functions.

</p>
        <p>While wholesale is often treated as a separate business entity, there is often a need to roll-up retail and wholesale plans into a singular total company view. As such, Wholesale functionality within TG JE is embedded beside Retail functionality. Rather than creating separate plans for Wholesale and Retail, the TG JE structure supports wholesale as a channel within the total company plan. This allows for easier movement of planned stock, sales, and other metrics as demand may shift from one channel to another, as early as the planning process. By composing the TG JE module to treat Retail and Wholesale as parts of a Total, revisions during the execution phase are also easier to implement.

</p>
        <p>These Release Notes are crafted to keep Wholesale-related functionality grouped together; structured as a logical progression through the planning and execution processes. It is important to keep in mind that the enhancements noted in this section, are also visible in the standard retail modules, as applicable.</p>
        <h3>Establishing Wholesale Customer to Wholesale Account Relationships</h3>
        <h4>Using customer orders as sales history for Customers </h4>
        <p>From the Wholesale perspective, “sales” can be viewed in two ways within TG JE: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Sales (or orders) signifying stock movement from the Wholesaler to the Customer Accounts, are referred to as Sell-In</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sales made by the Customer Accounts to end-consumers are referred to as Sell-Out </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is reliable historical data for Sell-in across all accounts. Sell-out is not as consistently available. To that end, these accounts use Sell-ins (customer orders) in place of sales history for forecasting purposes and are managed by grouping multiple Sell-ins together into major accounts. </p>
        <p>A new weekly task, <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Generate Sales History from Customer Orders</span>, uses customer orders that happened in the past as sales history if the customer order went to an account. The relationships defined in Customer Manager determine how Customer order data rolls into which accounts.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Actualized Sell-In Sales are populated by Customer orders (with accounts being collections of customers); which adhere to the Customer/Account configuration. Customer orders with dates in the future are ignored.</p>
        <h3>Forecasting Wholesale Account Demand</h3>
        <p>Wholesale planners managing wholesale accounts can have accounts that split demand between multiple DCs. This functions similarly to TG JE's demand transference, though in this case wholesale accounts transfer their sales into DCs and not stores with demand aggregating to DCs only.</p>
        <p>Only the major accounts are forecast and replenished. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Vandelay Industries (the primary wholesale account)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandA</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandB</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandC</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Vandelay Industries is the major account and is the account that is forecast and replenished.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.4, the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account Manager</span> module was renamed <span class="Emphasis">Customer Manager</span> to reflect updates that support Wholesale planning. The enhanced functionality means sites can be set up as a new site type called <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> that represents a collection of customer accounts in a many customers to one <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site relationship. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 (like other entities, such as Site Groups 1-20) that can be used to show a hierarchy.  Users maintain the Customer entity and do the linking to the Account site entity in Customer Manager. </p>
        <p>Accounts are not directly replenished. All forecasted account demand is replenished at DCs where the stock is held until anticipated wholesale account purchases. The DC responsible for holding stock is defined in the  <b>Site Account Source Site Contribution</b> widget in Site Manager.</p>
        <p>Two new fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing the customers under an Account site type and setting default contributions</h4>
        <p>Wholesale planners can, when managing wholesale accounts, use Site Manager to see the customer names for sites of type <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> by selecting a new blade <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Customer Relations</span>. The customer names are read-only as changes to the Customer Account relationship are performed in Customer Manager.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Site Manager/Site Account Customer Relations.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sites that are not of site type Account do not display any results.</p>
        <p>A second new blade in Site Manager, <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span>, displays a cross product of items in the hierarchy and all DCs. The blade displays, as a calculated percentage, the default contribution of each DC with the calculation being performed by new job task <span class="Emphasis">Calculate Source Site Percent Contribution for Accounts</span> which looks at an account’s sales history (customer orders). Users can use the <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> blade to refine contribution percentages as an override to set what percentage of an account’s projected stock each DC should hold. Overwritten values take priority over the calculated percentage.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Site Manager/Site Account Source Site Contribution.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>After a user enters a value in the <span class="Emphasis">Override</span> field and clicks <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> field for that row is formatted orange. The <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> functionality clears overrides for all the DCs for the item. When overrides are cleared the default contribution percentage is used.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If 10,000 units have a 50/50 split between 2 DCs out of a total of 4 DCs, then 5,000 units are sent to each of the 2 DCs.</p>
        <p>A new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Site Wholesale Account Distribution: ItemMaster Hierarchy ID</span> defines the hierarchy used. (For more information, see the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.)</p>
        <h4>Assigning clusters to Wholesale Account Cluster sets
</h4>
        <p>There is a new Cluster Type in the Site Clustering Module labeled <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account Cluster</span>. How sites are selected remains unchanged and is the same as with the other previously existing Cluster Types. Users do not select or create wholesale account clusters within the UI as these are automatically created within the import process. However, users will need to open new wholesale account cluster sets and click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> to assign the correct clusters. The result is Cluster Sets that have the correct Clusters assignments with a 1:1 Cluster to Site relationship. Snapshots continue as normal.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Editing a Cluster Set will show the Classifications created.</p>
        <h3>Merchandise Financial Planning</h3>
        <p>As noted, rather than creating separate MFP plans for Wholesale and Retail, the TG JE structure supports wholesale as a channel within the total company plan. This allows users to include sites with a site type of Account. The channel name will be whatever name is included in the Site Group 1 - 20 metadata.</p>
        <p>The wholesale channel can be included in a hierarchy, along with sub-channel hierarchies beneath the wholesale channel, for use in individual plans by account.</p>
        <h4>Including wholesale totals in the hierarchy</h4>
        <p>If the desired functionality is to include wholesale accounts in MFP but not plan them individually, then all that is necessary to do is include the Channel group in the MFP hierarchy configuration (or whichever Site Group indicates which sites are Retail and which are Accounts). Then the wholesale channel will be available when hierarchies are generated.</p>
        <h4>Including Individual wholesale accounts in the hierarchy</h4>
        <p>To include wholesale in the Channel hierarchy, the following steps must be taken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>One of the Site Groups 1 - 20 should be used to represent each wholesale account.  For example, <span class="Emphasis">Site Group 7</span> is given a friendly name such as <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Representing Wholesale Account.PNG" class="LargeImages">
                    </img>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Import Site Group values that exactly match each Account, and assign that SiteGroupID value to each wholesale account site.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">All Retail sites / DCs / other sites will have value of 0, No SiteGroup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Include the Site Group level in the Global Groups configuration in MFP.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Level Global Groups Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages">
                    </img>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Users can then view individual wholesale accounts in the MFP hierarchy.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>New metrics supporting the wholesale channel</h4>
        <p>In addition to following standard formatting, these new metrics conform to the existing MFP metric nomenclature.</p>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <p>All the below metrics have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> an <span class="Emphasis">LY</span> version of the metric, which is named with <span class="Emphasis">LY</span> prepended to the metric name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a <span class="Emphasis">Comparison 1</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Comparison 2</span> version of the metric, which is named with the comparison plan name appended to the metric name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an asterisk if dynamic renaming of the metric is in place to support the use of these values in either a Retail or Wholesale context.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sites and customer accounts</h4>
        <p>Retail Sites and Customer Accounts cannot co-mingle in MFP.  Data for wholesale accounts can exist in their own hierarchy levels alongside retail hierarchy levels, but at the leaf level, they cannot intersect.  For example, if the brand is <span class="Emphasis">ToolsGroup Tees</span>, the Toolsgroup Tees-owned retail site Irvine and the Customer Account called <span class="Emphasis">Irvine Sport Shop</span> that resells ToolsGroup Tees branded items cannot both exist in the <span class="Emphasis">Total Company &gt; USA &gt; Southwest</span> Channel.  </p>
        <p>The hierarchy must be further divided to separate sites and accounts, or hierarchy levels with mixtures must be excluded. If a mixed hierarchy level is included, the following message displays:</p>

        <h2>Supply Constraints</h2>
        <p>A high-level goal of ToolsGroup JustEnough is to capitalize on Sales (Demand), with an assumption that orders can (and will) be made to achieve the necessary supply (or stock). However, individual suppliers do not have infinite capacity to manufacture stock or fulfill orders. With these capacity constraints in mind, TG JE v2023.4 introduces functionality to define supplier capacity, based on a defined Construction Type attribute. These capacity constraints can then be applied during order generation, by using a Supplier Constraint order macro. This functionality is available during both Wholesale and Retail order generation.</p>
        <h3>Assigning Supplier capacity through Attributes <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">Supplier Manager</MadCap:conditionalText></h3>
        <p>A new import associates suppliers with Attributes. The import fields are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>ConstructionCode</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>SupplierCode</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ranking</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>ActiveFlag</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A construction code can be associated with multiple suppliers. For example, if the construction code is <span class="Emphasis">SHIRT</span> then there can be multiple suppliers that can manufacture construction code <span class="Emphasis">SHIRT</span>.

While the construction code is very specific, the actual supplier constraint is an Attribute, which can be any Attribute. </p>
        <p>Ranking is the list of suppliers that sets the order in which suppliers are used before consuming the next supplier’s capacity. It is possible to have different rankings per construction type. For example, for shirts, supplier A is  ranked 1 and supplier B is ranked 2. Whereas, for ties supplier B is ranked 1 and supplier A is ranked 2. </p>
        <p>Each supplier can have multiple construction types and multiple construction groups associated with them. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Supplier 1: (V-necks, T-shirts, and Tank Tops)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Supplier 2: (T-shirts, Dress-shirts, and Collar Shirts)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Construction type can be based on any finite capacity such as material, machinery, time required to complete manufacture of required amount of items, and so on. Said another way, construction type is something associated with the constraint that a supplier has in terms of the material, fabric or other factor related to the ability to actually run the production of the product and what limitations the supplier has.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Constraint: Construction Type</span> (Module: Order Manager) defines which Attribute to use for supplier constraint.</p>
        <p>Should a product not have an Attribute associated with it then the new macro, <span class="Emphasis">Apply Supplier Production Limitation</span>, available for Supplier orders in Order Manager, will not be applied and supply will not be constrained. The macro requires a product’s Attribute to be associated with a construction type in order to constrain by that construction type. Without that association, there is no link to the particular macro and supply cannot be constrained.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The Attribute needs to be set prior to creating purchase orders.</p>
        <h3>Reviewing suppliers associated with Attributes</h3>
        <p>A new blade labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span> has been added to the main view in the Supplier Manager module. Selecting a supplier in the top grid refreshes the blade to display the Attributes associated with the supplier. Within the <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span>, users define the production capacity (what the supplier can make and how much they can make) for each Attribute for a time period. Construction type is an Attribute of the supplier and is also an Attribute of items. Construction type is not a level of the hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The supplier and the construction types that the supplier can provide are visible in a new blade within Order Manager labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span>. </p>
        <h3>Specifying capacities in time periods</h3>
        <p>Additionally, a second blade, <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Construction Type Capacity</span>, has been added to the Supplier Manager module. This module shows a cross product of time buckets and construction type of the selected supplier. Users should use this module to define the production capacity of a supplier for the given time bucket.  If a time frame is left unedited, it is assumed the supplier has an unlimited capacity for the given time frame for that construction type.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Constraint: Bucket Type</span> (Module: Order Manager) defines the time period to use for the supplier constraint. The bucket range is based on today and the value for existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Future Days</span> (Engine: Forecasts).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Supplier/Supplier Construction Type Capacity Widget.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Only the <span class="Emphasis">Total Supplier Quantity</span> field is editable with all other columns being read-only. Planners can multi-select cells in the <span class="Emphasis">Total Supplier Quantity</span> field to specify the capacity in that bucket.</p>
        <h3>Supplier production constraints</h3>
        <p>When an order line is selected, the new <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report </span> blade, which displays when the <span class="Emphasis">Details</span> toolbar button is clicked, populates with all the suppliers that have the order line’s construction type.  Planners can review how much production capacity is left for each supplier of the construction type and how much of the capacity is taken up by pending stock. Supply planners can also manage scenarios where all suppliers are unable to fulfill the order so that exceptions are managed effectively.</p>
        <p>Often times a wholesaler’s constraint lies with supplier production. In this scenario and bearing in mind each supplier can produce X amount of construction types a month, a supply planner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> looks at all the unconstrained orders today

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>adjusts the order quantity based on constraints such as

production capacity or orders for a particular vendor have been particularly low.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, the <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span> displays recommended orders for today without any supplier constraint applied. Planners can review and apply supplier constraints to recommended orders as needed by applying the supplier production limit of a construction type to the values in the <span class="Emphasis">User Order Quantity</span> field in the top grid using a new macro, <span class="Emphasis">Apply Supplier Production Limitation</span>. The values update automatically with the results displaying in the <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span> blade.  </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Pending Order Quantity.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>In the above example, the value in the <span class="Emphasis">Pending Order Quantity</span> field is the sum total (64)  of the previously authorized orders (33, 31) shown in the <span class="Emphasis">User Order Quantity</span> field.</p>

        <p>The default value that displays in the <span class="Emphasis"> Remaining Quantity</span> field is set in the Supplier Manager module against the bucket with the desired delivery date. Another product with the same Attribute contributes to the capacity. Failing to run the <span class="Emphasis">Apply Supplier Production Limitation</span> macro may, upon an order being Authorized, result in the value in the <span class="Emphasis"> Remaining Quantity</span> field turning negative due to an over commit. In this scenario, Planners can use the <span class="Emphasis">Retract</span> toolbar functionality to reverse the authorization and then run the macro against the order. This will add new order lines in the top grid and leave a positive value in the <span class="Emphasis"> Remaining Quantity</span> field.</p>
        <p>Order lines that go beyond a supplier's production capacity split with the excess overflowing to the next ranked supplier of the same construction type. The resulting multiple order lines have the same order date, but different order quantities and  source supplier. Order quantities that exceed all available supplier capacity default to a supplier called <span class="Emphasis">Not Known</span> which has a limited capacity. Users should examine all <span class="Emphasis">Not Known</span> suppliers and either push the order and/or delivery date to a future production date or find additional supplier capacity to satisfy the order quantity of that construction type. Suppliers that have not been configured have a limited capacity rather than no capacity. The process does not look ahead to take orders from the next bucket (time period).</p>
        <p> In the following, <span class="Emphasis">Intra State Supplies</span> was applied first being the default supplier with <span class="Emphasis">Mass Supply Shipments Inc</span> applied second being the next ranked supplier. </p>

        <p>Planners can now see all the different suppliers for a selected order line based on the order line's  construction type (construction types have a 1-to-1 relationship to items), the production capacity of each supplier over time, and how much of the production capacity is being used already by authorized orders.</p>
        <p>The Order Date defines which recommended order lines of the same construction type are processed first with the earliest order date going first. The order in which suppliers are used to fulfill a construction type is dictated by the supplier construction priority provided during import.

        <h3>Secure Single Sign On (SSO) with Auth0</h3>
        <p>For ToolsGroup JustEnough v2022.3 onwards, ToolsGroup&#160;JustEnough has selected Auth0 as its Single Sign On (SSO) module. Auth0 is an authentication and authorization platform that provides a highly secure environment in which users sign-in with their email address and password or choose to continue if they have already signed in to another application such as Gmail or Microsoft Office 365. This eliminates the need for repeated system sign-ins for an improved user experience and simplifies the management of user names and passwords for organizations.</p>
        <p>Auth0 verifies whether users are authorized to access ToolsGroup JustEnough using credentials provided by third-party Identity Providers such as Google, Okta, or Microsoft. All user management including the configuration and authentication of email addresses is handled by Auth0  while passwords are managed by either Auth0 or the third-party Identity Provider.</p>
        <p>Users are presented with Auth0's Universal Login when signing-in.</p>

        <p>Auth0's Universal Login is customizable allowing organizations to display their own logo and colors as well as any desired wording along with the ability to offer one or more integrated SSO modules. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The full capabilities and benefits of Auth0's Universal Login and SSO functionality can be reviewed by following this link: <a href="https://auth0.com/single-sign-on">Single Sign On</a>.</p>
        <h4>Deprecation of Identity API and NameServer</h4>
        <p>With the adoption of Auth0, Identity API and NameServer are deprecated from v2022.3 as all the relevant functionality is now integrated into Auth0. This deprecation involves a Breaking Change. </p>

        <h4>Supported authentication protocols</h4>
        <p>Auth 0 supports the following authentication protocols: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and JSON Web Token (JWT) delivered via the OAuth 2.0 protocol </p>

        <h4>File Storage API</h4>
        <p>A new File Storage API can handle Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) allowing for the import and usage within ToolsGroup JustEnough of a user's images. Users will need to supply the image name, image file extension type, and the image's URL to the Repository Import Export utility for imports.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Repository Import Export Utility and Repository Management API have been enhanced to accept URIs and will now pass the images to File Store API for storage and usage. For Repository Manager, users will need to provide the name of the file the image should be stored in. </p>
        <p>There is a check to verify if the image's URL has changed and whenever the image is accessed past a specified amount of time.

When the URL is changed for the document ID, the cache of the image is cleared and re-imported.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">Data Access Layer</h2>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <h3><a name="2022.2DB"></a>2022.1</h3>
        <p> v2022.1 introduces the new Inventory Level Archive (ILA) data store to the Merchandise Financial Planning and Assortment Planning modules. </p>
        <h4>Reducing performance consequences and storage costs of real-time data aggregation</h4>
        <h4>Assortment Planning and Merchandise Financial Planning (MFP)</h4>
        <p>Throughout the modules, in particular planning modules, it is useful to have a record of what stock units were on hand in stores for dates in the past. This gives insight into stock holding history for comparison and lets users know what the most recent stock position was as of last week, so that future weeks' stock positions can be calculated based off demand and receipt plans.</p>
        <p>This data store is referred to within ToolsGroup JustEnough as an Inventory Level Archive (ILA) and there can be performance consequences and storage costs when the ILA data store contains too much history for too many items. This is particularly true for large-volume customers where repeated aggregation of static ILA data is time-consuming and the volume of data itself consumes considerable space.</p>
        <p>To address these issues, v2022.1 introduces a new variant-location ILA aggregate to the Assortment Planning and Merchandise Financial Planning modules. The new variant-location ILA aggregate reduces the incidence of real-time aggregation, thus, reducing performance consequences and storage costs of repeated aggregation of static ILA data.</p>
        <p>The Assortment Planning and Merchandise Financial Planning modules do not need stock on hand history at such a granular level as SKU-location; variant-location is perfectly sufficient for these modules. By summing up the SKU-location level ILA table into a variant-location ILA aggregate, systems can reduce storage space in their databases and reduce performance time when modules use the aggregated data store rather than the detailed one.</p>
        <h4>Configuring which ILA data store to use</h4>
        <p>Two new system policies (one for Assortment Planning and one for Merchandise Financial Planning) determine the source of stock on hand data to use during actualization. By default, the system policies are set to <span class="Emphasis">Inventory</span> with the data source being a SKU-location level ILA table. Setting either or both system policies to <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span> lets customers take advantage of a variant-location ILA aggregate for the relevant module.</p>
        <p>The new system polices are:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;mc-table-style: url('../Resources/TableStyles/standard.css');margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;" class="TableStyle-standard" cellspacing="0">

                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information on the above system policies, refer to the System Policies section.</p>
        <h4>Upgrading to  v2022.1 from a previous version</h4>
        <p>If upgrading from a previous version, there is no need to re-import data for the aggregation to run. Simply run the aggregation as a one-off after the upgrade to establish an aggregate ILA. Afterwards, whenever new imports are run, the newly imported values will be maintained going forward (assuming one of the system policies is set to <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span>).</p>
        <p>However, data can be reimported if desired. There does not yet exist a direct import into the variant-location ILA aggregate table; only the existing SKU-location ILA import continues to exist. This import has been changed to append processing to automatically cache imported SKU-location data into the variant-location aggregate. However, in order for the automatic caching to occur, one of the Stock On Hand Actualization Source system policies needs to be set to <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is strongly suggested to break the initial data import into smaller pieces, rather than trying to import all the data at once. This helps minimize the risk of the import failing.</p>
        <h4>Impact to historical EOP values of changing the data source</h4>
        <p>Historical EOP values can vary slightly depending on whether the data source is the existing SKU-location level ILA or the new variant-location ILA aggregate. The difference has to do with how the system looks backwards over time to find the stock on hand for an item.</p>
        <p>In the following example,  the recorded EOP for the period wk08 (which is from 17 February to 23 February) differs slightly between the SKU-location level ILA and the variant-location ILA.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <h4>Existing SKU-location level ILA</h4>

        <p>Currently in MFP and AP, there is no look back period when using SKU-location ILA data for historical stock on hand values. An ILA record between 17 February and 23 February is queried and the last record is chosen. Since there is no record in these dates, EOP is reported as 0 units.</p>
        <h4>Variant-location ILA</h4>
        <p>The dates used for variant-location ILA data is regulated by the system policies that maintain SKU-location ILA data (by default, the calendar used for data retention is to keep daily records for a month, weekly records for 2 years, and monthly data beyond that). Further, when variant-location ILA data is populated, it uses a look-back period to find the last record present for an inventory, not just the last record to occur within the week or month. Thus, weekly records are created, and a record for 23 February is created. The result is the records in the variant-location ILA aggregate will look more like this:</p>

        <p>In this scenario, the look-back logic used to populate variant-location ILA data means that there is a weekly record to be found by MFP or AP when looking for an EOP value; a record is found in the period between 17 February and 23 February, so the application will report 130 EOP units.</p>
        <p>Thus, it can be expected that historical EOP values will likely be higher when Variant mode is enabled for SOH actualization, because it is accounting for data that was previously omitted.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
        <h3><a name="2024.1BC"></a>2024.1</h3>
        <h4>Inventory </h4>
        <p>The exceedingly old and replaced pair of tables, <span class="Emphasis">tbl_ArchiveInventory</span> and <span class="Emphasis">tbl_ArchiveInventoryStatus</span>, having been deprecated since JE 3.5.2.2, are explicitly excluded from any Purge activities.  In addition, the database Foreign Key linking the former to the core <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Inventory</span> table has been removed (DROPped) and will not be reinstated.  Any custom code still referencing these tables ought to be eliminated entirely.</p>
        <p>Any custom or TG JE support developed Inventory Purge procedures must be removed immediately and never reinstated.  The new Inventory Purge supports purge of data from both TG JE core and any custom tables using InventoryID.  Using any other purge mechanism is unsupported and is undertaken at the user’s own risk.</p>
        <h3><a name="2023.4BC"></a>2023.4</h3>
        <h3>Assortment Planning and Target Choice Count</h3>
        <h3>Aggregation changes to TY Act New Choice Count applying values across clusters evenly</h3>
        <p>Choice Count Aggregations in the Target Worksheet are no longer verifiable within the worksheet itself; the totals represent at true unique count of variants across segments, updates, and location. The unique counts can be verified by data in the Data Cleansing and Choices By Update reports.</p>
        <h3>Merchandise Financial Planning</h3>
        <p>Previously, calculating Actual EOP DC Split included On Order data, but this was incorrect as On Order is separately tracked. Now, On Order is no longer included as part of Actual EOP DC Split.</p>
        <p>Also, the metric Available On Hand (Available On Hand = On Order + Stock On Hand + Reserved - Pending) was put into the Actual EOP DC Split value.</p>
        <p>However, the Reserved and Pending values were not looked up meaning only On Order and Stock On Hand were used. Now, the Available On Hand calculation actualizes into the MFP field <span class="Emphasis">Available On Hand</span>, and the sum of Stock On Hand and Reserved actualizes into Actual EOP DC Split.</p>
        <p>Both Reserved and Pending are now controlled via the following new system policies (the default is excluded from calculation):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">DC Stock Include Pending</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">DC Stock Include Reserved</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both system policies can be enabled (separately) to be incorporated into the Actual EOP DC Split and Available On Hand fields.</p>
        <h3><a name="2023.3BC"></a>2023.3</h3>
        <h3>Allocations</h3>
        <p>The Rebuild Forecast code for cachefields update procedure has been removed. This removal should have no effect as direct calls were False and the nightly batch, with True, didn't call the Rebuild Forecast code at all. The cache manager will NO longer allow the Rebuild Forecast to be set to True. Logic has been added to call a new Batch Exclusion procedure.</p>
        <h3><a name="2023.2BC"></a>2023.2</h3>
        <h3>Assortment </h3>
        <h4>Capturing logging information when making site exclusion changes</h4>
        <p>The tables <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Placeholder_SiteExclusion</span> and <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Placeholder_InstanceSiteExclusion</span> have had the non-nullable fields <span class="Emphasis">CreateUserID</span> and <span class="Emphasis">CreateDate</span> added to them.</p>
        <p>There are no default values on these columns, so any procedure that writes to these tables will need to account for this and include data.</p>
        <h3>Database </h3>
        <h4>New process to reuse InventoryIDs from purged inventories</h4>
        <p>A new process has been incorporated into the Inventory Import Process to reuse InventoryIDs from purged Inventories whenever possible.  This implementation includes removing the Identity property from InventoryID in tbl_Inventory.</p>
        <p>This change could impact any custom process that is not using the standard Inventory Import mechanism to add Inventories.  Any process that is trying to insert directly into tbl_Inventory should be modified to use the standard mechanism, as the direct insert will most likely fail.</p>
        <h3>Price Manager </h3>
        <h4>New method templates for Validations and Calculations</h4>
        <p>Price Manager template Validation and Calculation code is provided in the form of two pairs of SQL Stored Procedures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> pricemanager_C.Validation_PriceTemplate_ItemSite.sql and pricemanager_C.Validation_PriceTemplate_VariantSite.sql</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> pricemanager_C.Calculation_PriceTemplate_ItemSite.sql, and pricemanager_C.Calculation_PriceTemplate_VariantSite.sql</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When using Product Level = ItemSite, access to a SQL Server temporary table for logging is provided to each Item-Site Method’s procedures.  That table is renamed from #ValidationLog to #ValidationLog_ItemSite.  </p>
        <p>Any Item-Site CUSTOM Validation or Calculation Methods that reference the old table name must be edited to the new name and recompiled.  The column-complement has not changed for this Product Level.</p>
        <h3>Promotions </h3>
        <h4>Old Calculation Process replaced with Gateway</h4>
        <p>For some time now, the creation of a new Promotion Strategy would automatically assign <span class="Emphasis">usp_Promotion_CalculateClusterPricing_Standard</span>  as the procedure to be called by <span class="Emphasis">usp_Promotion_CalculateClusterPricing</span> when calculations are run, but it was possible through SQL to replace the assignment with a custom procedure in <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Promotion_Common_Strategy</span>.</p>
        <p>With this change,<span class="Emphasis"> usp_Promotion_CalculateClusterPricing</span> will no longer reference <span class="Emphasis">tbl_Promotion_Common_Strategy</span> to determine the procedure to be run and will instead always execute <span class="Emphasis">promotions.Calculate_Gateway</span>.</p>
        <p>This means any custom procedures that have been implemented this way will no longer execute, and any custom functionality will need to implemented through calculation configuration.</p>
        <h3>Site Manager </h3>
        <h4>Enhancement to Site status checks</h4>
        <p>Site status checks have been enhanced to check for end date time 23:59:59 and start of the day time 00:00:00. A migration script part of usp_Site_SiteStatus_Migrate that will update Start Date time to 00:00:00.000 and End Date time to 23:59:59.990 has been added to usp_MigrateAll.</p>

        <h3>Target Choice Counts </h3>
        <h4>ROS extrapolation updated to avoid crossing zero</h4>
        <p>Within Target Choice Count/Creation, previous functionality was to rationalize the comparison ROS values and make placeholder ROS recommendations to the point where additional recommendations are not mathematically justified. Beyond that point, if a user wished to add additional placeholders, the logic was to create a decreasing ROS slope to be applied against additional, user-requested recommendations. A function of the previous slope method was that the slope could reach or cross a zero (or negative) ROS.</p>
        <p>The logic used to create the extended slope for ROS values to be applied against additional placeholders has been updated in such a way that it will never reach or cross zero. This allows users to create additional placeholders and receive suggested ROS values for each placeholder, regardless of the number of additional placeholders being requested.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Creating a large amount of additional placeholders could result in very small ROS values for some placeholders. This is a function of a decreasing ROS slope.</p>

        <h3>Assortment</h3>
        <h4><a name="Enhancem"></a>Enhancements to the Ship from Store (SFS) and Fulfillment functionality</h4>
        <p>TG JE v2022.2 introduced a new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store %</span> (SFS) that allows for  planning sales in one Cluster Set and fulfilling them in other Cluster Sets. This is done by setting the <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store %</span> in the selling Cluster Set to the percentage of sales to be fulfilled by the other Cluster sets. For TG&#160;JE v2023.1, there have been significant enhancements to the Ship from Store (SFS) and Fulfillment functionality.</p>
        <p>These enhancements introduce a breaking change if SFS planning has been in use prior to implementing v2023.1 or v2022.4.2.0. An additional script should be run after applying the Quarterly Release or Cumulative Update. That script can be obtained by contacting TG&#160;Professional Services.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information on the  enhancements in the way the Ship from Store (SFS) and Fulfillment functionality is applied, refer to the <cite>Assortment Planning</cite> section and see Improved visibility to sales and fulfillments across Cluster Sets.</p>
        <h4>Variant Order Multiple now stored at the Placeholder level</h4>
        <p>Variant Order Multiple is now stored at the Placeholder level rather than Placeholder Instance (the field <span class="Emphasis">VariantOrderMultiple</span> has moved from assortment.Placeholder_Instance to assortment.Placeholder).</p>
        <p>Also, this change was made within the snapshot tables - moved from assortment.Snapshot_Placeholder_Instance to assortment.Snapshot_Placeholder.</p>
        <p>Please adjust any custom implementations that reference these fields.</p>
        <h3>Installer </h3>
        <h4>Client Installer - UIL upgrade incompatibility</h4>
        <p>usp_Common_File_Cleanse_FileActionType has been updated to include the full list of files necessary to set to CopyFileToExecutablePath. This file has CUSP hooks. Therefore, it is important that the CUSP procedure is be updated appropriately.</p>
        <p>The update was in response to a scenario where a customer with the 2022.3 client updated the UIL plugins to 2022.4 using the import utility. After updating the plugins, the customer was no longer able to download plugins. Though the client could see plugins loading the UI opened without any modules loaded.</p>
        <p>Debugging identified that the File Action Types for certain files were incorrect due to usp_Common_File_Cleanse_FileActionType not having the full list of files necessary to set to CopyFileToExecutablePath. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This stored procedure is invoked by usp_Common_File_AddUpdate_FileData.</p>
        <h3>Merchandise Financial Planning</h3>
        <h4>Hybrid Dual Markdown plans (Cost and Retail)</h4>
        <p>When Sales or other metrics are modified in MFP, Perm Markdowns $ now hold.  This is a change from previous functionality where Perm Markdowns $ calculated and Perm Markdowns % held.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information relating to this Breaking Change, navigate to the <cite>Merchandise Financial Planning</cite> section and see Changing Sales plans while holding existing permanent markdown values.</p>

        <h3>JSON TimeSpan format change </h3>
        <p>In proxy routing configuration and routing configuration, there is a timeout specified. If there are 3 colons in the configuration, there will be an error when upgrading. </p>
        <p>If there is a timeout in any configuration files, those would need to be changed as well. Users need to manually go in to check that these timeouts are in the correct format when upgrading.</p>
        <p>Timeouts should not be set in days. If timeouts are set in days, there will be a process error and smaller chunks of data should be handled.</p>

        <h4>Import Export API</h4>
        <p>Import Export will now need to provide which instance name is being worked with in the appsetting.json file. Usually, the instance name is the company name.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This is an additional configuration that did not exist before.</p>
        <h4>Identity API and NameServer </h4>
        <p>With the introduction of Auth0 integration, Identity API and NameServer are deprecated. New MSIs will not install those two features and upgrades will require users to uninstall older versions. It is always recommended to uninstall and do a fresh install when upgrading.
		</p>
        <p>Compute nodes now require internet access for authentication. Only one port is needed to talk to Auth0, no inbound port is required.
		</p>
        <p>All new login management will now be handled in Auth0. One gateway per environment is needed, but one login will work for all environments.</p>
        <h3>Promotions</h3>
        <h4>Improvements in the configuration of fields used within the Promotion Price Details UI</h4>
        <p>Code changes have been made to implement improvements in the configuration of fields used within the Promotion Price Details UI.  It is recommended that the display formats be verified between the  promotions.Promotion_Column_Configuration  table and the legacy tbl_Promotion_Common_Strategy_FieldConfiguration_Field table.</p>
        <p>Any incorrect display formats can be fixed using the Promotion Field configuration tool in the Promotions module by resetting the display format for the affected parent field.</p>

        <h4>Forecast lost sale calculation for online stores with no stock on hand</h4>
        <p>The Signature of the <span class="Emphasis">usp_Analysis_LostSales_Calculate</span> procedure has been modified to include <span class="Emphasis">@iSupplyChainID</span> to support lost sale calculation for online stores with no stock on hand and added more strict validation to the User ID and Filter ID.</p>
        <p>If <span class="Emphasis">@iSupplyChainID</span> is NULL, system policy <span class="Emphasis">Supply Chain Default Active Supply Chain ID</span> is used. This parameter is only used if <span class="Emphasis">Use Primary Source SOH for Lost Sale Calc</span> is checked. If Filter ID is null, the lost sale calculation no longer runs on ALL items.</p>
        <h4>SQL Server</h4>
        <h4>Required support for SQL Server 2017 <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-81064</MadCap:conditionalText></h4>
        <p>SQL Server 2017 is required to run Allocation Strategies successfully with ToolsGroup JustEnough v2022.2. While the Common Language Runtime (CLR) script would still run on SQL Server 2016, running allocation strategies will fail.</p>

        <h4>Assortment Planning</h4>
        <h4>Adding Attributes as columns</h4>
        <p>Stored Procedures assortment.LineViz_PlaceholderCollection_Select  and assortment.LineViz_Placeholder_Select have an additional parameter named @vAttributeSetIDs - this represents a list of AttributeSetIDs linked to the Product Hierarchy in the Assortment Plan.</p>
        <p>This attribute has also been added to the cusp calls for these Stored Procedures, the signature of any cusps would need to change.</p>
        <h4>Merchandise Financial Planning</h4>
        <h4>Hybrid Cost</h4>
        <p>Orders to be received in DCs that are NOT a part of MFP channels are now split and included in the On Order metric.</p>
        <h4>Order Manager</h4>
        <h4>Custom metric use within order documents has been enabled</h4>
        <p>OrderManager.Order_CustomTableOrderLineIdentifier_Add now expects the parameter @vCallingContext which specifies the SP that called it e.g. “assortment.Commitment_Generate_Post”. This can be used to define which temp tables may be active at a given time due to the OrderManager.Order_CustomTableOrderLineIdentifier_Add procedure being called from multiple sources.</p>
        <p>OrderManager.Order_CustomTableOrderLineIdentifier_Add_Post now expects the parameter @vCallingContext which is supplied by OrderManager.Order_CustomTableOrderLineIdentifier_Add.</p>
        <h4>Promotions</h4>
        <h4>Deprecation of un-needed columns</h4>
        <p>The following columns have been deprecated from the table tbl_Promotion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>SiteClusterAttributeID</p>

        </ul>
        <p>These columns contain no useful data, but their removal has resulted in the parameter signature for procedure usp_Promotion_AddUpdatePromotion and related CUSP POST procedure calls.</p>
        <p>Any CUSP procedures in use need to be verified to make sure that the deprecated columns or related parameters are being referenced.</p>

        <h4>Size Model view</h4>
        <p>There is an known issue where when importing the Size Model view using the import tool, an error: (Error in Action “COMMON_MULTIPLEX_ACTION_MESSAGES” was raised by PLUGIN) will be shown. Re-importing the Size Model view or importing the view in the UI will avoid the error.</p>

        <h4>Allocations</h4>
        <p>For Total Push, an issue where zero units are calculated if the amount entered in the Push Qty field is LESS than the available DC stock is resolved with ToolsGroup JustEnough Cumulative Update v2022.2.1.0. The Cumulative Update is recommended for customers using the Total Push functionality.</p>

        <h3>Real-Time Retail (RTR) batch reduction</h3>
        <p>TG JE v2023.2 introduces functionality that allows those customers who are unable to action Real-Time Retail (RTR) recommended orders on the same day to set the date for generating recommended orders to the following day. This enhancement enables the RTR functionality to better reflect real-world scenarios.</p>
        <p>The new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> enables the generation of RTR recommended orders for the following day when the policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span> (default). By setting the policy to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span>, customers also gain the flexibility to reduce their nightly batch run times.</p>
        <h4>Batch exclusion for recent recommendations</h4>
        <p>Under the default setting, if an RTR recommended order was generated within the last 18 hours, and <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> is enabled, the system skips generating new recommended orders for related items. This allows customers to avoid wasted time running unnecessary batch calculations within a short time frame.</p>
        <h4>Existing functionality</h4>
        <p>When <span class="Emphasis">Generate Orders Starting Tomorrow or Today</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">Today</span> orders generated will NOT be excluded from the nightly batch process.</p>
        <h4>Benefits of setting the system policy to the default</h4>
        <p>When the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">Tomorrow</span>, customers can still take advantage of Real-Time Retail instant decision making without having to wait for the nightly batch process. This reduces their dependency on the nightly batch and offers the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Faster Order Processing: Customers can process tomorrow's orders today if their supply chain processes allow, facilitating quicker fulfillment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reduced Nightly Batch Needs: By generating recommended orders for the following day, customers can minimize the number of nightly batche runs, optimizing system performance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Configuring the time elapsed since last calculation for batch exclusion</h4>
        <p>New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Time Elapsed Since Last Calculation for Batch Exclusion</span> allows customers to reconfigure the default 18-hour time limit. Customers can specify the number of hours for batch exclusion, although it is not recommended to exceed 24 hours.</p>
        <h4>New job tasks</h4>
        <p>To facilitate the recommended order generation and batch exclusion process, the following new job tasks have been added:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">(AL, RP) (Daily) Enable Batch Exclusion Process</span>

        <p>To effectively implement the recommended order generation and batch exclusion process, the <span class="Emphasis">Enable Batch Exclusion</span> task needs to run before the Ordering Engine Executions. <span class="Emphasis">Disable Batch Exclusion</span> should run immediately after. The reason being if <span class="Emphasis">Enable Batch Exclusion</span> is left on, then orders generated by users during the day would be excluded as well.</p>

        <h3>Getting insight into real-time data received from TG&#160;Onera </h3>
        <p>The real-time data feed that planners can receive, if configured, from ToolsGroup Onera reporting changes to the stock on hand (SOH) value of an inventory can now be reviewed using a new graphical interface. This dashboard functions as a central control center for today’s recommended actions providing planners insight to if and when they should generate orders for today.  “Oh Shoot!” moments are avoided as soon as possible. </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Real-Time Retail Dashboard</span> view provides a visually interesting and easy way to gain insight into the following data received from TG Onera's Inventory Hub: 

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>today’s Stock on Hand events
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
the number of Recalculation events that resulted today

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the recommended order quantity and generated order quantity for today
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
the last 25 events that resulted in a threshold process event </p>

        <p>Once planners think it is a good time to generate an order form for today’s orders, orders can be created directly in the view by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Generate Order</span>.

        <h3>Batching items to eliminate delays in processing</h3>
        <p>A new RTR Queue Marshall job task has been created to eliminate conflicts when items are manually calculated or calculated by RTR. With a stream of current data, and the need to process that data, along with typical user actions, keeping the stream of real-time data separate from the other job tasks is imperative to not delay calculations triggered other user actions. The RTR Queue Marshall batches groups of related items together for much faster batch processing. This greatly accelerates processing times and improves the user experience.</p>
        <p>There are two new Job Manager jobs for the new RTR Queue Marshall  job task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Queue Marshal RTR - Allocations</span>

        <h3>Responding real-time to changes to stock on hand (SOH)</h3>
        <p>As of TG JE v2022.4, planners can now receive a real-time data feed from ToolsGroup Onera that reports any changes to the stock on hand (SOH) value of an inventory. TG Onera receives feeds from client ERP systems, and then feeds real-time data via a Webhook into TG JE. </p>
        <p>To take advantage of this functionality, TG&#160;Onera is required and an API key from TG&#160;Onera configured to access and authenticate with TG&#160;JE.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> The value provided by TG Onera is the total remaining SOH at that time and not the delta between the original and new values. </p>
        <p>The integration of a continuous data feed means users can be notified in real-time that a fast selling item is approaching its defined end of period safety stock level allowing them to react accordingly. This gives planners the ability to avoid unexpected stock outs and lost sales while also avoiding over ordering stock. The result can be significant cost savings.</p>
        <p>The real-time data feed is in addition to, and faster than, the existing nightly batch process as users don't have to wait overnight to update SOH&#160;values. It is important to note that the data feed does not replace the existing overnight batch process and still relies on the nightly batch for the complete import and process.</p>
        <p>The Notifications sent to users are silent in that they don't pop up on the screen to avoid being intrusive. The arrival of Notifications is indicated by an increase in the notification flag count at the top-right of TG JE screens. Additionally, Notifications are aggregated to avoid recipients from being overwhelmed.
		</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Comparing new SOH values against thresholds</span>
        </p>
        <p>The new real-time SOH values are compared against thresholds defined within TG&#160;JE. When the new SOH goes beyond a threshold, the outstanding need for the item is calculated, and an order automatically generated ready for review. These new orders are treated by TG JE as if they were manually processed.</p>
        <p>The thresholds are recorded at individual inventory. The thresholds are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>time based: If the system’s current time exceeds this value, a recalculation is triggered. The value is set to be 1440 minutes (24 hours) from the last known Engine run date or today.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>value based: If SOH falls below this value, a recalculation is triggered. The value is set to be an Inventory’s End Of Period Safety Stock amount for their current time period (i.e this week or this month).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>forced flag based: When true, a recalculation is always triggered. This is set to true when there is no recommended projection data for an inventory for their current time period (i.e. this week).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">A CUSP hook has been provided to grant customers the ability to set the Forced Flag, Time, Value entries as they see fit. This does not grant the ability to change how the thresholds are evaluated. For Value based checks, an Inventory’s SOH is always used. However, instead of EOP Safety Stock being the value, it may be another value provided by a more complex calculation.</p>
        <p>For example, an item has 100 SOH at the start of the day and a defined safety stock level of 20. TG&#160;JE receives a continuous feed from TG&#160;Onera with updates showing the item is continuing to sell briskly. At a certain point during the day, an update is received with a SOH value of 19. As the SOH has dropped below the defined safety stock level of 20 the item is processed and an order is generated.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Allocation and replenishment items</span>
        </p>
        <p>Once a threshold has been crossed,  a replenishment runs or an Allocation strategy runs  (if there are multiple strategies defined for the item, only the smallest strategy ID runs).</p>
        <p>A replenishment item is the item master associated with that replenishment. The item master runs using defined system policies.</p>
        <p>These allocations and replenishments are placed into new specific Workload Queues (made for this purpose) that only handle intra-day processed items. Items that are queued multiple times are grouped together up to the point when the calculation runs. This helps reduce the noise associated with items with constantly changing stock levels. The 2 new Workload Queues are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Real-time Retail Allocations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Real-time Retail Replenishment</p>
            </li>

        <h3><a name="2022.4STS"></a>2022.4</h3>
        <p>TG JE v2022.4 introduces an optional integration (via a Webhook) with a Stock-to-Service calculation that defines the right level of inventory based on historical and forecast sales data. This Stock-to-Service calculation is an analytical curve developed by TG Service Optimizer 99+ (SO99+) affecting the <span class="Emphasis">safety stock days</span> of applied inventories. </p>
        <p>This new calculation is in addition to TG JE's existing target service level calculation and applies to all previous order policy types that use Target Service Level such as Normal Stock and Redundant order policy types. This affects normal and redundant stocks because it targets safety stock which can be set in either Policy on a filter of items, or it could be set on individual inventories in Inventory Manager and Policy Information (via the <span class="Emphasis">Policy Information</span> blade).</p>
        <p>The Stock-to-Service calculation is a change from a fixed stock service level to an optimized service level. The result is that the Target Service Level itself can automatically change between 0% to 99% service level in accordance with policy restrictions causing the actual achievable service level to differ from a user's input due to constraints. </p>
        <p>

For example, a user inputs a desired service level of 90% in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Service Level</span> field on the Inventory Manager screen. However, maximum stock is set in such a way that the maximum possible service level achievable is 75%. In this scenario, the value in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Service Level</span> field automatically adjusts to 75%. The automatic adjustment prevents any false expectation on a user's part that they are satisfying a 90% service level when the maximum achievable is 75%. This automatic adjustment occurs in near real-time giving quick and clear visibility that a setting is preventing the desired Target Service Level which is not as easy to see with a Policy Task.</p>
        <p>However, if an Inventory Planning Policy batch process has been configured as part of a policy task, then the automatic adjustment to an achievable service level, that is different from the user's input, occurs when the batch process is run and may not be immediately visible. When the batch process runs depends on all the policy tasks that were set up. The Policy Task only runs when started by a nightly job or from the Policy module when the user clicks <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span>.</p>
        <h3>Constraint example</h3>
        <p>For inventory with no sales history or forecast, regardless of the values input in the UI, the system would automatically set demand parameters at 0 for the inventory and the calculated Target Service Level at 0% since there is nothing to satisfy.</p>
        <h3>Enabling Stock-to-Service</h3>
        <p>Enabling the Stock-to-Service functionality requires an API key and URL from ToolsGroup Professional Services. Once configured, users must configure a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Safety Stock Calculation Type</span>. The new system policy replaces existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Use New Safety Stock Calculation</span> which is deprecated as of TG JE v2022.4. </p>
        <p>The configuration options for system policy <span class="Emphasis">Safety Stock Calculation Type</span> are: </p>

        <h2>Assortment Planning</h2>
        <h3><a name="2024.1AP"></a>2024.1</h3>
        <h3>Defining default pricing relationships across currencies</h3>
        <p>Within Assortment Planning (AP), pricing decisions are important. Pricing might vary from one Cluster to another, and the complexities of various currencies and exchange rates also make pricing complex. ToolsGroup JustEnough has previously supported pricing strategies, without having to manage pricing individually, through the <span class="Emphasis">Price Point Matrix</span> screen (Price Matrix module). </p>
        <p>AP now provides better support for planning in multiple currencies through an alternate process, <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span>, to manage pricing. Instead of defining translation rules, users define pricing relationships across currencies by means of a matrix.</p>
        <h4>Home AUT and Blended AUT</h4>
        <p>AP now distinguishes between two different types of AUT (or Average Unit Ticket, for example, the ticket price intended to be printed on merchandise tags). </p>
        <p>The first of these, <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>, represents the AUT value for the country and currency of the defined Home Site as set in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> screen for AP.  This is the starting point for planning AUT, as this value is user-editable.  <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> is only editable - and only has a value - in future periods. From this, <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived.  </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is considered to be a true representation of the expected earnings for a given item.  <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> incorporates several components, each of which is enabled by system policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>VAT Rate changes between the Home Site and sites within each cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Price Exception Factors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Price Matrix conversions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Only Price Exceptions OR Price Matrix conversion can be enabled at once (but both can be disabled altogether if desired).  VAT Rate changes cannot be enabled if Price Matrix conversions are enabled.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived in future periods from <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>.  In past periods, as <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> has no values, <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived from provided sales history.</p>
        <p>These two metrics are available in the following views: Collection, Placeholder, Cluster Sets, Multi-Currency Price View, Sales Plan, and Top Down Core Plan.

Additionally, these metric have been added to the following read-only report views: 
Assortment Rollup and Reconciliation.</p>
        <h4>Price Matrix functionality
</h4>
        <p>If a user enables Price Matrix conversions via system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Conversion Method</span>, and sets a Price Matrix on a given placeholder, then the configured Price Matrix is used to convert the provided <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> value to <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span>.
</p>
        <p>The following is a worked example to demonstrate the usage and value of this new functionality.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Multi-Currency Price Point Matrix Example.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>In the example, the Price Matrix configuration indicates that USD $67.99 is equivalent to PLN zł270.  The matrix is meant to encapsulate both currency conversions and elegant rounding, or the standard price endings based on currency and locale, like ending prices in 99 cents in USD.</p>
        <p>The Price Matrix should be specified as a hierarchy default so that newly created placeholders can automatically inherit this property.  </p>
        <p>Users can set default parameters for the <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span> fields via two new corresponding fields added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> view. Setting default parameters saves having to manually set values each time. The defaults can still be changed later by users if needed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The new fields display on the far right (currently moved for screenshot purposes), and they follow the same coloring and editability rules as the other defaults. Both fields show a dropdown for default selection.</p>
        <p>Then, when new placeholders are created with a given <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>, a <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> value can automatically be created. Users can review Price Matrix conversions via the following two new fields added to the main planning view: <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Price Matrix MPV UI.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is not necessary to set a Price Matrix Rounding rule.  If a Price Matrix is specified, but no Rounding rule is specified, then <span class="Emphasis">Nearest</span> is used.
</p>
        <p>
The specific usage of the Price Matrix can also be viewed in the <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span>.  Users can see how, for each period, the <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> value converts into each specific currency's value. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Multi-Currency Price View.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To reflect the introduction into AP of the Price Matrix functionality, the existing <span class="Emphasis">Price Exceptions</span> view was relabeled <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span> also indicates whether any value was missing from the indicated Price Matrix value, for example, if a site in the cluster had currency GBP but this currency was not included in the Price Matrix.
Missing Price Matrix values will also be noted in the Health Check fields in the main planning view.
</p>
        <p>If a Price Matrix is set for a placeholder, then the application attempts to use the Price Matrix data to convert AUT values. If any of the following components are missing, a new Health Error, <span class="Emphasis">Missing Data in Price Matrix</span>, displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Health Error</span> field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the home site's country / currency</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the selling sites' country / currencies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a row in the matrix for the starting Home AUT value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>currency conversion data for converting non-Home currency values back to the home currency</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the AUT values are converted from <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> values to currency-specific values using the Price Matrix, all AUT values are then converted back to Home currency using currency conversion rates, and a weighted average is used to calculate the cluster's combined <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> value.

</p>
        <p>Each period and cluster's <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> values can be modified in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view, and <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> for each period and cluster can be viewed there as well.</p>

        <h3>Purging old or inactive curves in assortment planning and allocations </h3>
        <p>Functionality has been added to the existing job <span class="Emphasis">(Weekly) Maintenance: All Modules</span> to garbage collect inactive and deleted curves used both in assortment planning and allocations.</p>
        <p>The garbage collection process does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>deletes references in curves table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>deletes references from profile table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve link tags</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curves from allocation strategies and marks those strategies as missing configuration</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curves from the assortment hierarchy, placeholders, rate of sale and both inventory and level forecast configuration</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Including the Attribute Lookup Description in the Manage Locations view</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Locations &gt; Manage Locations</span> view has been updated to include the Attribute Lookup description which may be much more meaningful to users than just the Lookup Code of a Site attribute. What displays is governed by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Display</span> (Module: Assortment). See the <cite>System Policies</cite> section for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="2023.4AP"></a>2023.4</h3>
        <h3>Wholesale planning</h3>
        <p>New functionality relating to wholesale planning was introduced for TG&#160;JE v2023.4. For a complete description, see <MadCap:xref href="#2023.WSPL">Wholesale Planning</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Enhancements to Target Creation</h3>
        <p>TG JE v2023.4 introduces new metrics allowing users to view the approximate average stock per choice. These metrics are identical for Target Creation in both AP mode and standalone Target Choice Count mode.</p>
        <p>For information, see the <cite>Target Choice Count</cite> section.</p>
        <h3>Improved stock to sales threshold formatting</h3>
        <p>Formatting has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view and the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view so that the <span class="Emphasis">Stock To Sales</span> column will have red text if the value is below the default lower threshold or above the default upper threshold.</p>
        <h3>Viewing Product Code and/or Product Description in product hierarchy dropdown</h3>
        <p>The product selection dropdown in Placeholder and Collection views can be configured to display 1. just the product description, 2. just the product code, or 3. the product code and description. Which fields to display is set using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Product Level Display</span> (Module: Assortment).</p>
        <h3>Planning discount/promotion rates that update the AUR</h3>
        <p>A new feature allows users to plan an AUT Discount percentage (Rate). This discount rate can be planned on its own, or in conjunction with specific planned promotions within AP. This allows users to manage item-level AURs without using the Promotions view in AP. </p>
        <p>The plannable metric, <span class="Emphasis">AUT Discount %</span> allows a user to plan a discount percentage which is not otherwise defined through specific promotions.  The reduction in AUT is then automatically applied against the AUT and used to update the planned AUR. This eliminates the need to plan the AUR.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">AUT (average unit ticket) is the ticket price, and AUR (average unit retail) is the retail price paid by the customer. </p>
        <p>For example, if the AUT is $100, and various promos, etc., cause that variant to go out the door at an average AUR of $80, a user might plan a discount or promotion rate of 20%, and that would update the planned AUR.</p>

        <h3>Enhancements to Target Creation</h3>
        <p>TG JE v2023.3 introduces enhancements and new functionality around Target Creation. These enhancements and functionalities are identical for Target Creation in both AP mode and standalone Target Choice Count mode.</p>
        <p>For information, see the <cite>Target Choice Count</cite> section.</p>
        <h3>Easier cluster management for placeholders and collections </h3>
        <p>In TG JE v2022.2, sub clustering by attribute was introduced. With that functionality, clusters can be created which support clustering by grade and sub clustering by climate.</p>
        <p>However, each of those cluster-sub cluster combinations needed to be managed individually. For example, swimwear might have an earlier phase-in date for Warm stores than for Cold stores. Previous functionality required updating the phase-in date for A-Warm, B-Warm, C-Warm, etc. one at a time. </p>
        <p>To improve the user experience, <span class="Emphasis">Sub Cluster</span> has been added as a field for use in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view, and can be used at an aggregated level (for example, update the phase-in date for all Warm stores at once). This field is best placed in the <span class="Emphasis">Column Area</span> of the grid.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Sub Cluster Cold Warm.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Now users can bulk edit across sub clusters, supporting user stories such as defining phase dates by sub cluster attribute at an aggregate level, rather than for each cluster-sub cluster at a time. Values are apportioned and pushed down according to existing rules within the system. Editability is as per the existing rules.</p>
        <p>The value that displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Sub Cluster</span> field is the value selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Sub Clustering Attribute</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Cluster Set</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Update Cluster Set</span> screens within the Site Clustering module. This field displays <span class="Emphasis">N/A</span> if the cluster does not have a sub-cluster.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view has been updated to respond to the selection of multiple placeholders or placeholder collections in the main planning view. Three new fields have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Fields Customization</span> form to facilitate this enhancement. The new fields which identify the placeholders selected are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Placeholder ID</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">PH Code</span>
                </p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">In the <span class="Emphasis">Collection</span> view these fields will be the corresponding Placeholder Collection identifiers.</p>
        <p>These fields are best used in the <span class="Emphasis">Row Area</span> and are most useful when showing multiple placeholders at once. For example, users can view values at a more aggregated level across multiple placeholders / clusters.</p>

        <h3>Recalculating receipt plans in the Top Down Core Planning (TDCP) view</h3>
        <p>With the addition of editable Receipt metrics for TG JE v2023.1 in the TDCP view, any placeholders that have been modified have a receipt status of <span class="Emphasis">Dirty</span> and are flagged for recalculation.</p>
        <p>To recalculate modified placeholders, a button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> has been added to the TDCP view. Clicking this button initiates the same logic as the <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> button in the main planning view. The new button uses the parameters defined within TDCP to determine which placeholders to recalculate.</p>
        <p>It is possible that multiple users might be affecting the same placeholders through different views (Receipt Plan view and TDCP), and also possible that these users might recalculate at similar times. To efficiently address this possibility, queue logic skips placeholders which are no longer dirty though the first recalculation. The recalculation does not auto-run the parameters as users could be working at the time.</p>
        <p>Notifications are sent to users to indicate the status of the run. Clicking on the Notification takes users back to the TDCP. </p>
        <p>Also, the following two new metrics which show additional placeholder level detail have been added to the TDCP view: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Receipt Status</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Last Receipt Run</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Receipt Constraints are still managed exclusively through the Receipt Plan view, which supports multi-editing.</p>
        <h3>Working with preferred layouts within the Cluster Sets view</h3>
        <p>Users can now filter fields in the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view. There are many fields available within this view, with more added as additional work is completed. Some of those fields may not be useful for all planners. To make this view more user-friendly the <span class="Emphasis">View Style</span> dropdown has been removed and replaced with a <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Set View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> button displays  a screen similar to the standard <span class="Emphasis">Fields Customization</span> screen. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Sets Fields Customization.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The only difference is that the filter, row, and column sections are absent. This is because only the data items can be amended. Users can move fields between the <span class="Emphasis">Data Area</span> and <span class="Emphasis">None Area</span> to show or hide fields. Both sections are multi-select enabled to allow for bulk editing.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Cluster Sets Layouts.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p> When a desired layout has been achieved, users can right-click in the Cluster Sets grid and select <span class="Emphasis">Save Layout</span>. The original or another layout can be selected using the appropriate right-click menu option.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote"> A new optional script labeled <span class="Emphasis">assortment.Layout_INIT.sql</span> must be run if users wish to continue using the previously existing layouts from the <span class="Emphasis">View Style</span> dropdown. This script recreates the <span class="Emphasis">All</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Default</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Regular/Markdown/Future</span> layouts as shared layouts available to all users.</p>
        <h3>Configuring and automatically loading a default personal workspace</h3>
        <p>Within Assortment Planning, users can create and save workspaces. Workspaces are configurations of visible views which enable particular tasks such as setting (and saving a workspace with) Placeholder, Style Bank, and Cluster Sets views docked and visible to support Cluster Assortment planning. As an enhancement, users now have the ability to configure a default personal workspace that saves time and lets them do their work more effectively.  </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Manage Workspaces dialog.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the new checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Default</span> added to the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Workspaces</span> dialog to designate a particular workspace configuration as the default workspace. This default workspace displays  each time the application is loaded. Additionally, the default workspace can be edited and re-saved in future as needs change.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">As only private workspaces can be made default this functionality is specific to individual users only. A workspace cannot be a default if its <span class="Emphasis">Protection Type</span> is <span class="Emphasis">Public</span>.</p>
        <h3>Identifying which variants have been assigned </h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Map From Variant</span> field in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Placeholders</span> view is used to seed sales plans for new placeholders from historical ones. To enhance the usability of this field a new checkbox field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span> identifies which placeholders have a variant assigned.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Map From Variant.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Usability enhancements to the Receipt Plan view</h3>
        <h4>Reviewing periods with negative EOP in Receipt Plan view</h4>
        <p>The Assortment Planning module allows for complete configurability in sales plans and receipt plans independently.  However, if the two plans are not fully synchronized, this can lead to a situation where the receipt plan does not generate enough stock on hand to support the sales plan.  This can happen if there is insufficient lead time to support the sales plan, the markdown date comes too early, or receipt constraints are not sufficient.</p>
        <p>In the Receipt Plan view, the value in the <span class="Emphasis">EOP&#160;Units</span> field is now formatted with red text to better bring to the attention of users that there are negative values.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/EOP Field Formatting &amp; Behaviour.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>A new health check shows if the stock on hand plan goes negative at some point in the future of the plan. This check is only validated against the override <span class="Emphasis">EOP Units</span> value (i.e. incorporating user overrides of sales and receipts), and it only looks for negative values during the regular period of the item. Therefore, it is not a concern for an item to have negative SOH during the markdown portion of the lifecycle. The following is an example of the health error details:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Health Error Code Stock On Hand Negative.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h4>Ensuring future recommended orders are sufficient for ideal EOP&#160;quantities

</h4>
        <p>An issue where users entered an override receipt quantity in a week and the system still showed additional system receipt units in the same week has been resolved. These additional system receipt units resulted in future recommended orders being insufficient to meet the ideal EOP quantities. Now, if an override receipt value exists in a period, that period becomes ineligible for system recommended receipts and system receipt units is zero.</p>
        <h4>Recalculating Receipt plans without Dirty status</h4>
        <p>Users can now click the <span class="Emphasis">Recalculate Receipts</span> button when selected on a single placeholder and rerun the receipt engine, even if the status is not <span class="Emphasis">Dirty</span></p>
        <h3><a name="2023.1AP"></a>2023.1</h3>
        <h3>Avoiding slowdowns by disabling the automatic synchronization of Attribute changes</h3>
        <p>Attributes configured in Attribute Manager as Placeholder and/or Variant attributes, such as Season Type or Item Season, display as read-only columns in the main planning view. Though read-only, these attributes can be edited using the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> side view with changes automatically synchronized to the main planning view.</p>
        <p>In some scenarios, users who have both <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Attribute</span> views enabled and who are making many rapid bulk changes to placeholder attributes, such as is sometimes done to pre-season assortments, may see a system slowdown while the changes are synchronized.</p>
        <p>To avoid such potential slowdowns, a new option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Synch</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">View Options</span> dropdown menu in the main planning view. This new option allows users to disable the automatic synchronization of changes in the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> If <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Synch</span> is unchecked, there is no automatic synchronization between the views while a user  updates attributes via the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> view. This alleviates any related UI slowdowns. However, users must click <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span> to reload the main planning view to see the updates,</p>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view performance has been improved by amending some of the loading functionality.</p>
        <h3>Accounting for Stock in Transit within clusters</h3>
        <p>EOP and BOP values in all views and reports (such as the Sales Plan view and the Receipt Plan view) are now inclusive of Inter-Branch Transfers (IBT) for sites-in-cluster.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of IBTs within the EOP/BOP values helps minimize the occurrences of small EOP/BOP values where it appears a receipt is needed, but not recommended. Previously, EOP/BOP values might have been  unnervingly low, without a receipt. This was because IBTs were in the calculation, but not visible.</p>
        <p>If a user desires to understand BOP/EOP values WITHOUT IBTs, it is recommended that the EOP/BOP metrics be displayed beside the <span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit</span> values for a visual comparison.</p>
        <p>The following metrics <span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to Cluster</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to DCs Split</span> have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view and supplement the existing metric <span class="Emphasis">Total Stock In Transit</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to Cluster</span> is stock in transit to stores within a cluster specifically whereas <span class="Emphasis">Total Stock In Transit</span> is stock in transit to any locale in the network, (store or DC). <span class="Emphasis">Stock In Transit to DCs Split</span> is the difference between the two.</p>
        <h3><a name="Improved"></a>Improved visibility to sales and fulfillments across Cluster Sets </h3>
        <p>For TG&#160;JE v2023.1, there have been significant enhancements in the way the Ship from Store (SFS) and Fulfillment functionality is applied across Cluster Sets and clusters. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">These enhancements introduce a breaking change.  For more information, refer to the <cite>Breaking Change</cite> section and see Enhancements to the Ship from Store (SFS) and Fulfillment functionality.</p>
        <p>TG JE v2022.2 introduced the ability to plan sales in one Cluster Set and fulfill them in other Cluster Sets. This is done by setting the <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store %</span> in the selling Cluster Set to the percentage of sales to be fulfilled by the other Cluster sets. For example,  90% indicates that 90% of a warehouse's sales will be shipped from locations other than the warehouse.</p>
        <p>Previously, the SFS percentage only applied to clusters visible on the screen. Now the SFS percentage is spread to both selected and unselected clusters. This is done by spreading split DC stock across all cluster set / clusters, regardless of whether they are selected.</p>
        <p> There is now the ability to assign an SFS percentage to more than one cluster set. However, users cannot assign an SFS percent value to all clusters within a cluster set for a placeholder.  At least one cluster must be 0%. The same SFS percentage drives the different user and system generated metrics.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Fulfillment</span> metrics are now split out in both the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view and the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view to better reflect user entered values and system generated values. The system generated values are prefixed with <span class="Emphasis">System</span> for easy identification.</p>
        <p>The metrics now available in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view are:</p>

        <h3>Viewing and managing sales and receipts in a single view</h3>
        <p>Planners can now view and manage receipts in aggregate in a single repurposed view. The <span class="Emphasis">Top Down Sales Plan</span> view has been repurposed  with the addition of editable receipts and renamed to <span class="Emphasis">Top Down Core Plan</span> for TG&#160;JE v2023.1. This allows for simultaneously managing all placeholders for multiple collections instead of one collection or one placeholder at a time. Planners can now avoid the onerous and time consuming task of manually editing numerous individual collections or placeholders making sales and receipt planning much more efficient.</p>
        <p>For example, planners can use the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option to enter receipt quantities that are the same across multiple collections, saving a great deal of clicking.
</p>
        <p>In the same way with the existing sales planning logic, updates at lower levels aggregate up to higher levels while updates at higher levels split down proportionately to lower levels. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Care should be taken installing renamed widgets, views, and view collection sets. TG PS should refer to the following page in Confluence: <span class="Emphasis">Installing renamed TDCP widgets, views, and view collection sets</span>.</p>
        <h3>Cell locking</h3>
        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span> metrics take advantage of the existing cell locking functionality that can be applied to Sales metrics. Locking a Sales metric does not lock a Receipt metric and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Previously, the <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Productivity Comparison</span> metrics were a comparison of weekly productivity * selling periods. This was not really helpful as selling periods are almost always not all periods. The result was a <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Productivity</span> that appeared much too high against the Comparison. The metrics have been modified to be based on active periods and not all periods. Additionally, they have been renamed to be more explicit as to what they represent. These modifications provide a more realistic understanding of the connection from TY to Comparison.</p>
        <h3>Valid placeholders now complete actualization regardless of erroneous placeholders </h3>
        <p>Under the current design, when the actualization procedure runs, all properly configured plans get actualized. However, the actualization process stops once a threshold of errors occurs. This results in the actualization of the entire plan failing including valid placeholders, because of some invalid placeholders.

</p>
        <p>The actualization process has been redesigned to allow all valid placeholders to complete processing regardless of erroneous placeholders.  It has also been refactored to allow for easier identification and correction of placeholders in error.  System Policies have been introduced to automatically cleanse erroneous data as well. Additionally, new metrics allow for the quick identification of problematic placeholders.</p>
        <p>The new system policies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Automatically Mark Periods As Selling</span>
                </p>
                <p>If site counts are changing from 0 to non-zero (as in the case when users change cluster set snapshots to include sites in a cluster), existing functionality continues to treat these periods as non-selling. Now, users can set <span class="Emphasis">Automatically Mark Periods As Selling</span> to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, meaning these periods are automatically marked as selling.
				</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Lower Limit for Unit-Based Metrics</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Upper Limit for Value-Based Metrics</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information on the above system policies, see the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.</p>
        <p>The two new filterable metrics are now available in the main planning view at the placeholder level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Last Actualized Date</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Last Actualize Failed</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Investigating actualization failures</h3>
        <p>The existing <span class="Emphasis">Health %</span> field on the toolbar gives users a quick indication of what percentage of an assortment has issues that need to be addressed.</p>
        <p>In addition to the existing health error codes, new error codes have been added to the main planning view screen. These error codes display in the <span class="Emphasis">Health Error</span> field to indicate if values exist in the sales plan that are below the lower-limit threshold for sales units, or above the threshold-limit for AUT.

Users can click on the icon in the <span class="Emphasis">Health Error Details</span> field to review additional information in a pop-up.</p>
        <p>
A health check has been added that looks for 100% site exclusion rates. If this is encountered, a user will need to open the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Locations</span> view by clicking <span class="Emphasis">Locations</span> on the toolbar and opt sites back in.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Wherever future sales plans or AUT / AUR values are derived, the new system policies are used to verify values are not beyond the thresholds.</p>
        <h3>Actualization code changes

</h3>
        <p>Some changes have been made within the Actualization code itself to incorporate better error handling producing color-coded errors and detail within log tables, which can be referenced by the TG Support team if further investigation is needed. 
A new log table helps with debugging actualization, to determine the answer to the question “what placeholders were included in the batch?”.</p>
        <h3><a name="2022.4AP"></a>2022.4</h3>
        <h4>Assortment By Site Report enhanced to include committed &amp; on order units, as well as receipt units </h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Assortment By Site Report</span> has been enhanced to show a site level split for Receipt units, Committed units, and On Order units. Previously, visibility was lost once a receipt transitioned to Committed or On Order. To this end, the existing <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units Share</span> field has been replaced by a new <span class="Emphasis">Total Orders Units</span> field (Receipts + Committed + On Order) for better visibility.</p>
        <h4>Automatically ingesting external data into plans</h4>
        <p>External data can now be ingested automatically into an Assortment plan. A new standard weekly job labeled <span class="Emphasis">(AP) (Weekly) Refresh External-Sourced Plans</span> automatically updates external data eliminating the need to run the update manually. The new job should be configured to run at least weekly at any point after Imports run.  If external data is imported daily, then the job should be run daily as well.</p>
        <h4>External data enhancements </h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Seasonality Curve</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Lifecycle Curve</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Markdown Curve</span> fields in the main planning view now display <span class="Emphasis">(External)</span> to indicate the Curve in use is from External data. <span class="Emphasis">(External)</span> will only show if the Sales Units metric is set to non-editable in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Import Config</span> view (the <span class="Emphasis">External Editability</span> field is set to <span class="Emphasis">No</span>).</p>
        <p>The metric <span class="Emphasis">Projected Sales Units</span> is now configurable in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Import Config</span> view.  Depending on how this metric is configured, the <span class="Emphasis">Projected Sales Units</span> line in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view populates from either Replen or External.</p>
        <h4>Viewing Attribute values that are longer than 256 characters</h4>
        <p>TG JE v2022.4 introduces support for NVARCHAR(MAX) as a non-editable Attribute type enabling users to view attribute values longer than 256 characters. NVARCHAR(MAX) is only available in the Collection / Placeholder <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> supporting view.</p>
        <p> A related enhancement allows the <span class="Emphasis">Notes</span> field in the main planning view to display greater than 256 characters.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Attributes are visible in the main planning view but are managed within the Attribute Manager module.</p>
        <h4>Enhanced metric visibility in the Assortment Buy Sheet Report </h4>
        <p>A number of metrics in the Assortment Buy Sheet Report have been re-labeled to better reflect the data they represent. Additionally, new metrics have been added to give users visibility to where their orders are in the ordering process allowing them to know what receipts can still be canceled if needed.</p>

        <h4>Planning sales in one Cluster Set and fulfilling them in another Cluster Set</h4>
        <p>The percentage of a Cluster Set's sales that will be fulfilled by a different Cluster Set can be planned in advance using a new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store %</span>. The value entered in this field shifts demand by that value  from the selling Cluster Set to the fulfilling Cluster Set.</p>
        <p class="Example">For 100 sales units, a value of 90 in the <span class="Emphasis">Ship from Store %</span> field indicates that 90 units needs to be shipped from stock of another Cluster Set.</p>
        <p>However, the Total Sales accredited to the selling Cluster Set consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Fulfillment Sales</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ship from Store Sales</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Total Sales for the fulfilling Cluster Set is comprised of Fulfilment Sales only.</p>
        <p>Only Sales Units outside of currently selected Cluster Sets count towards Fulfillment Sales units in actualized periods (not counting sales fulfilled by a non-origin site within the same Cluster Set)</p>
        <p>There are no Product Hierarchy Defaults for the Ship from Store (SFS) metrics. Therefore, there will be no default SFS percent value which can be assigned to a higher product level. The SFS percent is managed at the Item level.</p>

        <h4>Data Source Type Configuration pane</h4>
        <p>To choose the Source Type for each field, click in the field to display a dropdown list of options. The options that display depends on whether a price (AUT/AUR) or a cost (AUC) type is selected.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This new functionality involves a Breaking Change. For more information, refer to <cite>Deprecated system policies and replaced settings</cite> in the Breaking Changes section.</p>
        <h4>Using sub-clusters to adjust phase periods based on site attributes</h4>
        <p>Previously, users could have cluster grades based on sales performance (A,B,C) or a qualitative attribute (cold, hot, warm), but not both at the same time. This enhancement allows store cluster sets to be graded and clustered (ABC) based on sales performance and then sub-clustered by a site-specific Lookup attribute type (such as cold, hot, warm), including user defined attributes. This gives users the ability to make adjustments to phase periods based on site attributes.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Whether an attribute is item or site specific is a property managed in Attribute Manager.</p>
        <p>Sub-Clusters are selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> screen by clicking in the <span class="Emphasis">Additional Allowed Cluster Sets</span> field and selecting them. The <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Details</span> side pane allows users to manage the assortment of placeholders and collections to Clusters and Sub-Clusters.</p>
        <p>It is possible to have regular Cluster Sets in the Plan as well, but these will appear as overlapping Cluster Sets. Placeholders cannot be assigned to both the Cluster AND the specific Sub-Clusters.</p>

        <h4>Configuring Sub-Clusters</h4>
        <p>If new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set Allow Sub Cluster</span> (Module: Cluster Site Manager) is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span> then sub-clustering is enabled in the Site Clustering module. The <span class="Emphasis">Sub Clustering Attribute</span> field displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Add Cluster Set</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Update Cluster Set</span> screens but only when <span class="Emphasis">Assortment</span> is the only module selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Module</span> field. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The ability to select and maintain Sub-Clusters requires User Right <span class="Emphasis">Allow Sub Cluster to be Maintained</span> (Right Group: Cluster Site Manager).</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>After configuring the Cluster Set or editing an existing Cluster to add a Sub-Cluster, click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> on the Cluster Set toolbar to display the Sub-Cluster details in the grid.</p>
        <p>

        <p>The Sub-Cluster comes into effect when a snapshot is created.</p>

        </p>
        <p>However, there is a very important provision. USERS MUST NOT ADD A SUB-CLUSTER TO A CLUSTER SET ALREADY IN USE IN AP. </p>
        <p> When the Cluster Set is recalculated with new Clusters (the Sub-Clusters being considered new clusters), and the new Clusters are snapshotted, then AP can no longer reference the old assortments to the non-attribute-based Clusters.  The old assortments disappear from view, and there is no way of surfacing sales plans made to old Clusters.  Data will not migrate from old Clusters to new.</p>
        <p>To use Sub-Clusters after AP plans are already established, configure a new Cluster Set with the attribute-based Sub-Clusters and snapshot it. In the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Details</span> screen, unassort from the old cluster set and clusters and assort to the new cluster set and clusters.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sales plans between old and new Cluster Sets will not be preserved.  A custom script will need to be written to migrate and split sales plans from the old cluster set / clusters to new.</p>
        <h4>Enhancements to the Reconciliation Report comparison parameters</h4>
        <p>With the goal of improving the user experience and to avoid possible confusion, how plans and snapshots display for selection in the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison</span> parameters has been enhanced as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the options in the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Type</span> field have been split out so that plans and snapshots are separate lines.
		 <p><img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Reconcilation Report Plan and Snapshot Lines.png" class="LargeImages"></img></p></li>
            <li>Assortment planning snapshots are now alphabetized.
			<p><img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Snapshots Alphabetized.png" class="LargeImages"></img></p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Merchandise Financial plans display in the same tree grid as the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> view.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Merchandise Financial plan snapshots show in a hierarchy view, with the parent plans shown. The Master and Branch plans are prepended with <span class="Emphasis">Plan</span> and the actual snapshots underneath listed alphabetically and prepended with <span class="Emphasis">Snapshot</span>. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/MFP Snapshots Hierarchy View.png" class="LargeImages">
                    </img>
                </p>
Sorting snapshots by name is a highly flexible approach that allows each organization to provide user direction on the naming convention to use to achieve desired sorting results. For example:<ul><li> 

YYYY-MM-DD (Product Hierarchy) Description

</li><li>(Product Hierarchy) YYYY-MM-DD Description

</li><li>Plan Year (Product Hierarchy)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Two of the same AP Comparison Type can now be selected at once. Previously, selecting an AP&#160;plan as both Type 1 and Type 2 just resulted in the second line showing 0 (zero) values. While the utility of this is limited when comparing the one available AP plan to itself, it is more useful when comparing two AP snapshots.  The existing limitation that prevents selecting 2 MFP plans or snapshots for comparison continues to be in place.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Viewing all Variant attributes in the Style Bank view</h4>
        <p>Previously, an Attribute had to be of data type <span class="Emphasis">LOOKUP</span> to display in the <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view. The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view now includes all Attribute data types for the Variants, in both the main planning view and the docked view in the Collection view.</p>
        <h4>Viewing actualized internal stock movement metrics </h4>
        <p>Four new metrics have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view to provide further visibility to internal stock movements (also known as Inter-Branch Transfers or IBT) between locations for historical periods. These metrics are only populated for actualized periods with future periods always being zero or null.</p>
        <p>These metrics are included in the calculation to provide the current period’s BOP value with all stock being considered regardless of where it is.</p>
        <p>The new metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Units In Transit Cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Units In Transit DC&#160;Split</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Cost In Transit Cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Stock Cost In Transit DC Split</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Setting Suppliers for Placeholders before assignment</h4>
        <p>A new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> lets users define a Supplier for a Placeholder before the Placeholder is assigned to a Variant. The <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> field updates to the Variant's default Supplier on assignment. The <span class="Emphasis">Style Bank</span> view also has a <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> field which represents the Variant's default Supplier.</p>
        <p>If new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Enforce Supplier matching before Variant Assignment</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, then the assignment of a Variant to a Placeholder can only occur if the Suppliers chosen are the same. If View Option <span class="Emphasis">Advanced Style Bank</span> is selected, then only records with matching supplier records are shown.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The new <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> field replaces the existing <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Code</span> fields. The new field shows a combination of Supplier Code and Supplier name. The main difference is that, while the Placeholder has not been assigned to a Variant, the <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> field is now editable allowing Supplier planning earlier in the process. The dropdown for the <span class="Emphasis">Supplier</span> column includes Supplier Code / Supplier Name as searchable columns.</p>
        <h4>Importing duty percentages at the Variant level</h4>
        <p>Previously, the <span class="Emphasis">Duty %</span> metric allowed duty to be defined at the Supplier level. This metric (along with <span class="Emphasis">Discount %</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Freight %</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Landed Cost</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Cost</span>) provides visibility to the cost components that comprise <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUC</span>. <span class="Emphasis">Duty %</span> has been enhanced to allow duty to be set at either the Supplier or the Variant level. With the duty percentage at the Variant level, different Variants from the same supplier can be defined with different duty percentages.</p>
        <p>If new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Variant Level Duty Percentage</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, then the duty percentage is from the Variant record. If the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">False</span>, the duty percentage is from the Supplier record. There is no visible difference within the Receipt Plan as only the data source is changed.</p>

        <h4>Navigating the main planning view task bar</h4>
        <p>To improve the user experience, task bar clutter in the main planning view has been reduced. The existing <span class="Emphasis">Receipts</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Replen</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Alloc</span> options are now in a single sub-menu under a new task bar option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Process Queue</span>. Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Process Queue</span> sub-menu includes a new section labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> with a single option called <span class="Emphasis">Retrend</span>.</p>
        <h4>Using Retrend logic to suggest revised Sales Plans at the Variant/Cluster level <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-79815</MadCap:conditionalText></h4>
        <p>v2022.1 introduces Retrend logic (specifically Monte Carlo) into AP.  This new functionality can be used to suggest a revised ROS for selected Placeholders and Placeholder Collections. </p>
        <p>The re-trending of ROS is a valuable tool to consider for products as they transition from a pre-season plan to in-season. As products begin to sell, their sales patterns inevitably trend away from the initial plan (sometimes in the positive, sometimes in the negative). The included re-trend mechanisms account for the trends sales and form an amended go-forward sales plan against which continued allocations may be structured.</p>
        <p>To use the Retrend functionality, navigate to the new <span class="Emphasis">Process Queue</span> sub-menu section labeled <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> and choose <span class="Emphasis">Retrend</span>. Selecting <span class="Emphasis">Retrend</span> runs Sales Plan retrend logic against the selected Placeholders and Placeholder Collections.</p>
        <p>
            <p class="BasicNote">There are four new Retrend-specific system policies related to this functionality. For descriptions, refer to the System Policies section.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The following metrics provide visibility to the results of running the Retrend functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A new group of Retrend metrics have been added to the grid in the main planning view and the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view. These new metrics display the results and status of the Retrend operation. </p>
                <p>For the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view, a  new View Style labeled <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">View Style</span> dropdown. Selecting <span class="Emphasis">Rate of Sale</span> displays the Retrend ROS metrics as well as Actualized Sales (if applicable).</p>
                <p>The metrics are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Retrend ROS (<var>currency</var>)</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Retrend Status (showing a status of either Clean or Dirty)</p>

                    <p class="BasicNote">Notifications have been added to the Inbox/process queue for Retrend submission status.</p>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The preceding metrics have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view: <span class="Emphasis">Retrend Sales</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Retrend Sales Units</span>.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">The fields for Retrend metrics populate only after a user selects the <span class="Emphasis">Retrend</span> option in the <span class="Emphasis">Process Queue</span> section of the main planning view toolbar.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Setting a target AUC for buyers </h4>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Margin %</span> metric is now editable in both the main planning view and the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Sets</span> view for both Placeholders and Collections.  This allows Planners to hand over Assortment Plans to their Buyers that includes information regarding a desired or target AUC the buyers should be aiming for when negotiating prices with suppliers. Entering a value adjusts the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUC</span> metric to allow this desired margin to be achieved.</p>
        <h4>Accounting for stock that is in transit</h4>
        <p>In Assortment Planning,  Total Order metrics are inclusive of supplier orders and internal stock movements (also known as Inter-Branch Transfers or IBT). New metrics differentiate between inbound supplier orders and IBT orders providing better visibility to these components. </p>
        <p>Additionally, On Order metrics have been broken down further across Assortment Planning views and reports to provide visibility to supplier orders that have been sent to the supplier (<span class="Emphasis">Committed</span>), received back from the supplier as confirmed (<span class="Emphasis">Confirmed</span>), or if there's an unknown status (<span class="Emphasis">Unknown</span>).</p>
        <p class="p">The new <span class="Emphasis">Past Due</span> metrics provide visibility to orders that were expected to be receipted in the recent past. Previously, such information was included in the current period but with no separate visibility to it. It wasn't easy to tell of the current period on order how much was past due versus how much was written to the period. Past Due is now broken out to provide visibility to all orders that are past due as well as current. These metrics provide much better visibility to where stock is, whether it's late or on time, whether it's moving inside the channel, etc.</p>
        <p>The new and renamed metrics are available in some or all of the following: <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view, <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view, <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Rollup</span> view, and the <span class="Emphasis">Reconciliation Report</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The Total Order metrics remain unchanged.</p>
        <h4>Inter-Branch Transfer metrics</h4>
        <p>Separate Cost fields have been added for each of the different On Order Unit metrics in <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. For example, <span class="Emphasis">Committed On Order Units</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Committed On Order Cost</span>. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Supplier Orders</span> has been added to  the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view, <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view, and <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Rollup</span> view. (Calculation: Committed + Confirmed + Unknown)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Total Orders Less Receipts</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view. (Calculation: Committed + Confirmed + Unknown + In Transit)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Total Orders</span> has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Rollup</span> report. (Calculation: Committed + Confirmed + Unknown + In Transit + Receipts)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Viewing Attributes as columns </h4>
        <p>v2022.1 introduces functionality that automatically displays Attributes that have been set up in Attribute Manager as Placeholder and/or Variant attributes, such as Season Type or Item Season, as read-only columns in the Collection view, Assortment view, and the <span class="Emphasis">Variant</span> view. Previously, each line had to be selected one at a time to refresh the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> side view which was time consuming and inconvenient.</p>
        <p>The Attributes can be edited using the <span class="Emphasis">Attributes</span> supporting view which allows for viewing and editing of the attributes associated with Collections, Variants, and Placeholders. Multiple Edits can be achieved by highlighting multiple entities in Collection or Placeholder view.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This new functionality involves a Breaking Change. For more information, see <cite>Adding Attributes as columns</cite> in the Breaking Changes section.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing changes to AUT in the Top Down Sales Plan view </h4>
        <p>The &#160;<span class="Emphasis">AUT</span> metric has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Top Down Sales Plan</span> view and the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison</span> view. This allows users to see how AUT has changed over time.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">AUT is editable in the main view and follows the same coloring rules as the other editable fields (Sales and Sales Units). AUT in the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison</span> view is read-only.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing how sales are matching with plans </h4>
        <p>Four new metrics have been added to the main planning view and the Cluster Sets view. These metrics show the difference between SPV Sales and Total Sales providing a convenient way to see how Sales are matching with Plans. The new metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>SPV Diff (<var>currency</var>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>SPV&#160;Diff (<var>currency</var>) %</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>SPV Diff (U)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>SPV Diff (U) %</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Viewing Pack Size in the Placeholder view</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">Pack Size</span> has been added to the Placeholder view. This metric provides a quick and convenient way for Planners to review the selected Pack Size for Placeholders with defined Packing Instructions. The value that displays is the total number of pieces in a pack for every size curve assigned to the selected Placeholder. </p>
        <p>For example, for a size curve for younger boys outerwear tank tops, if there are 6 different sizes and there is 1 piece of each size in a pack, then the value that displays is 6.</p>
        <p>The Pack Size is selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Pack Instruction Selector</span> grid in the <span class="Emphasis">Packing Instruction</span> supporting view. Changing the selected Pack Size in the grid updates the metric in the main planning view after <span class="Emphasis">Execute</span> is clicked and the change confirmed.</p>
        <h4>Changes to the behavior of the Mirror Options button </h4>
        <p>The default behavior of the <span class="Emphasis">Mirror Options</span> button in the Hindsight view has been amended. Previously, the default behavior was that the button was always unselected when the<span class="Emphasis"> Hindsight</span> view displayed. Now, the default behavior is to save the state of the button (whether selected or not) when the view is exited. For example, if the <span class="Emphasis">Mirror Options</span> button is selected, then the button is selected (highlighted) the next time the view displays.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The choice is stored  using new User Policy <span class="Emphasis">ASSORTMENT_HINDSIGHT_PARAMETER_MIRROR_CHECK</span>.

        <h3>Wholesale planning</h3>
        <p>New functionality relating to wholesale planning was introduced for TG&#160;JE v2023.4. For a complete description, see <MadCap:xref href="#2023.WSPL">Wholesale Planning</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Verifying which plans are Default and which are Original Plan</h3>
        <p>A new <span class="Emphasis">Plan Sub Type Name</span> column has been added as an available column to the <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Maintenance</span> screen to supplement <span class="Emphasis">Plan Name</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Plan Description</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Plan Type Name</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Plan Status Name</span>. The new column allows users to quickly and easily see which plans are Default and which are Original Plans.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Plan Sub Type Name column.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Plan Sub Type Name</span> can be added using the <span class="Emphasis">Choose Column</span> option on the right-click menu.</p>
        <h3>Configuring the source of forecast level data</h3>
        <p>The source of forecast data to use (whether Inventory forecasts or aggregated level forecasts) is defined using new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Source</span> (Module: Financial Planning). Level data should be chosen to expedite performance, but only if forecast jobs are set up to maintain hierarchy level data. The default is <span class="Emphasis">Inventory</span>.</p>
        <h3>Rebalancing metrics based on configured measure sets</h3>
        <p>Previous Rebalancing functionality allowed for Sales to be rebalanced between plans. There were <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Retail</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Cost</span> checkboxes for Receipts to be rebalanced, but that functionality was never enabled. With this enhancement within v2023.4, users can now rebalance metrics based on configured measure sets. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Measure sets are configured in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage</span> &gt; <span class="Emphasis">Configuration</span> &gt; <span class="Emphasis">Merge Measure Sets</span> screen.</p>
        <p>Rebalancing should only occur between plans of the same plan type. The <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Plan</span> screen has been updated to include a <span class="Emphasis">Measure Set</span> dropdown field. However, it is important to remember that the dropdown only displays measure sets relevant to the selected plan type. The <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Retail</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Cost</span> checkboxes are also now available for clicking.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Only the metrics selected for rebalance are affected within the destination plan. Any metrics unselected retain the values of the destination plan. As such, it is important to select all related metrics within a metric set for rebalance. </p>
        <p>For example, when rebalancing Receipts, a user should check all of the Target Receipt metric checkboxes for the full set of data to rebalance. Selecting only <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Retail</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span> without <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Cost</span> applies the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Cost</span> of the destination plan to the newly copied <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Retail</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span> values from the source plan, resulting in a newly calculated Receipt margin. Similarly, by not selecting <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUR</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Receipt AUC</span> values will not be direct copies as the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span> values in the destination plan become the divisor.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Rebalance functionality has not changed with the addition of this feature.</p>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a measure set is picked along with any of the <span class="Emphasis">Sales</span> / <span class="Emphasis">Sales Units</span> / <span class="Emphasis">COGS</span> / <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Retail</span> / <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Units</span> / <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Cost</span> checkboxes, it is the measure set that is copied and not the Sales and Receipt specific metrics even if the Sales and Receipt checkboxes are selected.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the Sales within the Source and Destination plan are not equal, the ratio of Source Plan Sales and Destination Plan Sales will be applied against other values being copied.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rebalance plans are only created with the time periods specified in the <span class="Emphasis">Rebalance Plan</span> screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Within the <span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown</span> plan type, there are metrics with rolling calculations using the designated (checked) Season Begin period. If the source and destination plans do not have the same Season Begin period, there will be some drift in these rolling metrics, two of note include, <span class="Emphasis">BOP Retail</span> and <span class="Emphasis">COGS</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="2023.3MFP"></a>2023.3</h3>
        <h3>Subset of Comparison Plan 2 metrics expanded to include additional metrics </h3>
        <p>The subset of metrics available for selection for the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 2</span> parameter in the main planning view has been expanded to include the following metrics that were previously only available for selection for the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> parameter:</p>

        <h3>Re-seeding planned values for future periods where LY has not actualized </h3>
        <p>Existing re-seed functionality allows users to re-seed a plan after planning has begun. When re-seeding, users can select a specific product hierarchy and a period of time as parameters.</p>
        <p>This functionality has been extended. Now, users can select a period of time for re-seed that is beyond 1 year from actualized data and where the LY values are non-actualized. The non-actualized or planned values for those future LY periods will be overwritten with the planned values for the LY planned period. </p>
        <p>A common use case for this is long lead-time categories, where plans are built on top of planned values. For example, footwear might have a 18 month lead time. In this case, months 13-18 plans are being built on the plans for future months 1-6.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">There is no change to Seed functionality.</p>
        <h3>Distinguishing between actualized values and outstanding forecasts within periods</h3>
        <p>Planners can separate sales and receipt information for selected calendar levels into aggregated actualized and outstanding portions using a new <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> metric within the <span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Financial Planning Grid</span>. Using this new metric, trends relating to actual sales versus planned sales can be easily distinguished from the balance of a forecast. For receipts, it allows planners to see what has already been received against what is expected to be received in the future within a time period. </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span>  replaces 3 metrics that were deprecated for TG JE v2022.3:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Month TD/TG
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quarter TD/TG
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Year TD/TG

</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">TD (to-date) represented an aggregation of the actualized portion of the selected period while TG (to-go) represented an aggregation of the remaining planned but not actualized portion of that period.

</p>
        <p>The new  metric can be used in the <span class="Emphasis">Filter</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Row</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Columns</span> in the pivot grid. In the <span class="Emphasis">Filter</span> area, users can choose either <span class="Emphasis">Elapsed</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Remaining</span> or both. This can be useful if deliberately planning only future periods or analyzing past periods,</p>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining Filter.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The following is an example of the <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> metric in the <span class="Emphasis">Row</span> section.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining Row.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>However, the recommended and probably the most common usage for this field is in the <span class="Emphasis">Column</span> area (the same area as time periods), and before Week. This allows visibility to the portion of the period which has actualized, and the portion which is still outstanding or remaining, with subtotals. The metric position could be higher to allow for subtotals such as quarter-to-date or year-to-date.</p>
        <p>Positioning of this metric within the <span class="Emphasis">Column</span> area is important as the split between Remaining and Elapsed happens within the period of time above or to the left of the <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> metric. </p>
        <p>For example, if <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> is positioned after <span class="Emphasis">Year</span>, then elapsed periods of time within the year split into the next calendar level down (such as Quarter or Month). Elapsed periods of time subtotal as <span class="Emphasis">Elapsed Total</span> and periods of time remaining subtotal as <span class="Emphasis">Remaining Total</span>.</p>
        <h4>Calendar Level Quarter</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining Column.PNG" class="LargeImages" style="width: 822px;height: 234px;" />
        </p>
        <h4>Calendar Level Week</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining After Year.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>When <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> metric is positioned after <span class="Emphasis">Quarter</span> or <span class="Emphasis">Month</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Elapsed Total</span> and the <span class="Emphasis">Remaining Total</span> are constrained to each quarter or month.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining After Half or Month.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p> In the below example, M05 is entirely Elapsed, and the monthly total is seen in the <span class="Emphasis">Elapsed Total</span> field. M06 is partially Elapsed and partially Remaining. The two totals combine to equal the value in the <span class="Emphasis">M06 Total</span> field. M07 is entirely Remaining meaning all its values are aggregated to the value in its <span class="Emphasis">Remaining Total</span> field. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Elapsed Remaining After Month.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>When the <span class="Emphasis">Remaining/Elapsed</span> metric is placed after the lowest calendar level (<span class="Emphasis">Week</span>), each period has a header indicating the status of that particular period. There are no subtotals at the lowest calendar level.</p>
        <p>

        <h3>Populating On Order metrics at plan creation only</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span> Sub Type has been updated to populate the <span class="Emphasis">On Order</span> metrics at the time of the plan creation only, and hold those values throughout (even though On Order data at time of plan creation may be incomplete, meaning zero values will persist). This is the case for all instances, including future dated OP plans (plans with the first period in the future). </p>
        <p>Before this change, in the <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span> Sub Type, the <span class="Emphasis">On Order</span> metrics updated over time. Other <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span> metrics are non-actualizing. Removing actualization from the <span class="Emphasis">On Order</span> metrics makes them more in line with the other non-actualizing metrics.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">On Order</span> metrics still update when a user re-seeds or merges plans of <span class="Emphasis">Original Plan</span> Sub Type.</p>
        <h3><a name="Changing"></a>Changing Sales plans while holding existing permanent markdown values</h3>
        <p>Hybrid Dual-Markdown plans (Cost and Retail) allow organizations to plan their Permanent and Promotional markdowns separately either as a dollar value or a percentage. Adjustments can be made to the Total dollar value or percentage, and those changes drill down to BOTH Promotion and Permanent markdowns, while holding the relationship between them. A consequence is that a change at the Total markdown level will adjust a previously entered Permanent markdown dollar value.</p>
        <p>This is especially true for Hybrid Retail Dual-Markdown Plan (HRDM) plan type where markdowns affect EOP/BOP.</p>
        <p>The locking functionality for the Hybrid Dual-Markdown type has been updated to better reflect the desired business case where users adjust the Sales plan but do not want to change the Permanent markdown values (which are planned based on stock price depreciation of stock on hand to be marked down, rather than affected by the Sales).</p>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.1, <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> metrics ($/%) can still be directly edited as desired, however, changes to a Sales plan no longer update the <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> dollar metric. </p>
        <p>Now, when a user has planned markdown values ($/%) for both Promotion and Permanent markdowns and adjusts the Sales plan for that period:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> % will hold, and <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> $ will adjust along with the Sales adjustment.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">The <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> dollar value continues to update in relation to changes to the Sales plan as those metrics are interrelated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> $ will hold, and the Permanent markdown % will adjust along with the Sales adjustment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Total markdown $/% will be updated based on the behavior of Promotion and Permanent markdowns as described.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the desire is to update Total markdowns while holding the <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> $ values, users should update the <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> ($/%) metrics, rather than Total markdown metrics.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This change to how the <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> metric is impacted when users change Sales or Sales Units (or other metrics) introduces a Breaking Change. For more information, see the <cite>Breaking Changes</cite> section.</p>
        <h3>Calculation toggle definitions</h3>
        <p>The calculation toggle definitions (which metrics calculate and which metrics hold) have been updated to reflect these changes. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The calculation toggles <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> relate to what happens when users change those metrics directly; that behavior has not changed.</p>
        <h3>Hybrid Cost (single markdown) plans</h3>
        <p>For Hybrid Cost (single markdown) plans, the majority of the Total markdown is associated with Promotion markdowns. As such, current functionality remains intact. That is, when a user has a planned markdown value ($/%) and adjusts the Sales plan for that period the markdown percentage will hold. The markdown dollar value will adjust along with the Sales adjustment.</p>
        <h3>MMU calculation toggle and associated metrics renamed</h3>
        <p class="p">The <span class="Emphasis">MMU</span> calculation toggle and associated metrics have been renamed to <span class="Emphasis">Gross Margin</span> to better reflect what they represent and to improve the user experience. </p>
        <h3><a name="2022.4MFP"></a>2022.4</h3>
        <h3>Targeting a profit margin by changing the selling price or cost</h3>
        <p>Previously, <span class="Emphasis">MMU % (Product)</span> was not an editable metric in MFP plans. <span class="Emphasis">MMU % (Product)</span> was a calculated field based on the user defined AUR (Average Unit Retail) and AUC (Average Unit Cost) values. For JE DM v2022.4, <span class="Emphasis">MMU % (Product)</span> is now editable for Cost and Cost Dual Markdown plans.</p>
        <p>Users can now target a profit margin (MMU%) by changing either the selling price (AUR) or the cost (AUC) and using a new calculation toggle labeled <span class="Emphasis">MMU %</span> to hold either sales or cost. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote"><span class="Emphasis">MMU % (Product)</span> remains read-only in Retail Dual Markdown plans because MMU is the basis for other calculations in the Retail plan type which would be negatively impacted if MMU was changed by users.</p>

        <h3>Comparing four financial plans simultaneously </h3>
        <p>Previously, in the main planning view it was possible to compare the current plan (TY), last year's plan (with metrics suffixed with <span class="Emphasis">LY</span>), and one more plan selected using the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan</span> parameter. The plan selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan</span> parameter might be the Master plan if working in a branch, a Branch plan to compare against another Branch scenario, a Snapshot, or an LLY (last, last year) plan from 2 years ago.</p>
        <p>The main planning view has been enhanced with new functionality allowing for the simultaneous comparison of 4 plans: TY, LY, and 2 additional Comparison plans (which might include LLY and a Snapshot or other Comparison type). </p>
        <p>The existing <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Type</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan</span> parameters have been combined into a parameter labeled <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> with this structure duplicated in a new parameter labeled <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 2</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Parameters - Hybrid.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The dropdown options in each parameter are labeled to indicate the type of Comparison:</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Comparison Plan Selections.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p> The <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 2</span> parameter returns  a core subset of 86 metrics compared to the metrics returned by the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> parameter. Therefore, it is important to remember that <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> returns the full metric set while <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 2</span> returns the abbreviated metric set. With this difference in mind, users could consider scenarios such as whether the full metrics are required for a Snapshot consideration and the subset of metrics for LLY, or vice versa.</p>
        <h4>Visibility to On Order Past Due and Total Supplier Orders </h4>
        <p>The following are new metrics for all plan types to provide visibility to On Order Past Due IMU and Total Supplier Orders IMU. TY, LY, and Comparison versions of the metrics have been
		added as well.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">IMU or Initial MarkUp is an important metric for planning because it shows potential profitability. IMU ($/%) for Total Supplier Order is particularly important as it's the profitability of all inbound orders.</p>
        <p>The new Total Supplier Order metrics were added to both the <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 2</span> parameters whereas the new On Order Past Due metrics were added to <span class="Emphasis">Comparison Plan 1</span> only. </p>

        <p>There are 4 Inventory Adjustment metrics that can be renamed and configured as clients require. One scenario is to set up metrics to signify the transfer of stock into Channels.</p>
        <p>New metrics provide visibility to the sub total of target receipts for a period plus any Inventory Adjustments that signify transfers in.</p>
        <p>The calculation is Net Receipts = Target Receipts + Inventory Adjustment Total. (Inventory Adjustment Total = Inventory Adjustment 1 - 4).</p>
        <p>The new metrics have been added for TY, LY, and Comparison 1 and cover all of the components of Target Receipts: Retail, Cost, Units, AUR, AUC, IMU% and the LY and % variance to LY. None of the metrics were added for the Comparison Plan 2 parameter.</p>

        <h3>Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown financial plans</h3>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough v2022.3 introduces a new financial plan type labeled <span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown (HRDM)</span>.  This new plan type applies a Cumulative Markup (CMU) percentage  to retail values to determine margin, cost of goods sold, and ending inventory for cost. This allows planning teams to focus on retail values and AUR while the CMU drives the efficiency and accuracy of financial plans.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Markdown metrics in a Hybrid Retail Dual-Markdown plan behave in the same way as the existing Hybrid Cost Dual-Markdown plan type.</p>
        <p>The new plan type is available through the <span class="Emphasis">Maintain Financial Plan</span> dialog during new plan creation:</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">The Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown plan type replaces the old Hybrid Retail plan type.</p>
        <p>As the name implies, there are two markdown metrics in the HRDM plan. The <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Perm)</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Promo)</span> fields are enabled for the <span class="Emphasis">Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown</span> plan type, as well as the <span class="Emphasis">Markdowns (Total)</span> field.

        <h4>Metrics disabled in Hybrid Retail Dual Markdown plans</h4>
        <p>AUT and IMU% are both not editable in the HRDM plan type, because their formulae have changed.  AUT is now equivalent to BOP AUR, and IMU% is equivalent to BOP Markup %.  Both are now automatically calculated.  Thus, the IMU % calculation toggle is disabled in HRDM.</p>
        <h3>New and renamed metrics</h3>
        <p>The following are new metrics enabled across all plan types.  Comparison and LY versions of the metrics have been added as well.</p>

        <h3>Custom metric actualization</h3>
        <p>There are some metrics in MFP that do not have a standard means of actualizing.

If this is desired, Custom Metric feeds must be configured with the following names:</p>

        <h3>Generalization Of component metrics</h3>
        <p>MFP has three sets of metrics called “component metrics". This means that they are corresponding parts of a whole other metric.  In particular, the metric set Comp and Non-Comp are parts of Sales; the metric set of Regular, Promo, and Markdown also are parts of Sales; and the newly added Target Receipts 1 and 2 are parts of Target Receipts.  The application now allows configurability as to which of these components are enabled and what they are called.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Component metrics have been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Generic Metric Configuration</span> view.  They can be repurposed and renamed in whatever way is desired; once saved, the changes will take effect in the MFP grid once it is reloaded.  In the above screenshot, Comp and Non-Comp are repurposed to represent two sub-channels where stock is fulfilled either via the company’s DC or supply chain, or via a wholesaler.  Thus, the fields are renamed to Warehoused and Factory Direct.</p>
        <p>At least two components in each component set must be included. For example, enable both Comp and Non-Comp, enable both TargetReceipts1 and TargetReceipts2, or enable 2 of the 3 Regular, Promo, Markdown set. Attempting to enable only 1 component generates the following error message:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/MFP/Enable Single Component Error Msg.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>In addition, there is the concept of a “primary” component.  This means that, if the total metric (e.g. Sales) is currently 0, and a non-zero value is added, then 100% of the value goes to the primary component.  The value does not evenly split among the components.  The primary component is indicated by a check mark in the <span class="Emphasis">Is Primary</span> column in the <span class="Emphasis">Generic Metric Configuration</span> view.  </p>
        <p>In the case of the 3-Part Sales Component Set (the Regular / Promo / Markdown set), then Regular MUST be enabled if the component set is enabled at all.  In other words, the user can disable all 3 components, or the user can disable ONLY Promo or ONLY Markdowns, but Regular cannot be disabled while allowing the other two to be enabled.  If a user attempts to disable only Regular, the following message will be displayed, and the changes will not be saved:</p>
        <h3>New component metrics</h3>
        <p>The following Comp/Non-Comp and Target Receipt metrics (including LY and Comparison for each) have been added.</p>

The <span class="Emphasis">Configuration</span> sub-menu includes a new option labeled <span class="Emphasis">Metrics</span>. The new <span class="Emphasis">Metrics</span> screen allows the enablement and configuration of generic metrics to be more implementation-specific.</p>
        <h4>Adjusting inventory levels quickly and conveniently </h4>
        <p>The ability to adjust inventory quickly and conveniently has been greatly enhanced with the introduction of new metrics labeled <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Reduction</span>. To make adjusting easier, the new metrics can be assigned intuitive user-friendly names using a new configuration screen labeled <span class="Emphasis">Metric Configuration</span>. </p>
        <p>Having separate individual metrics with user-friendly names makes it much easier to configure and review adjustments, and enhances planning of AUR associated with each.</p>

        <p>Previously, there were only two ways to manipulate stock. There was either the <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment</span> metric that could be used to manipulate stock on hand either positively or negatively (with negative numbers) or the <span class="Emphasis">Shrink</span> metric tied to BOP values. While this sufficed, it wasn't ideal as the metrics were not being used as intended and could not be renamed to a name that more clearly reflected what was happening.</p>
        <p>The previously existing <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment</span> metric  has been repurposed as <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment 1</span>. However, its calculation is unchanged. <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment 2-4</span> are copies of <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment 1</span>. Therefore, <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment 1-4</span> are identical in how they are calculated. All 4 can be given appropriate user-friendly names and used for different adjustment scenarios.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Reduction 1-3</span> metrics are all new and can be used in the same way as the <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment</span> metrics.

</p>
        <p>Adjustment and Reduction fields initialize the same way as the original <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Adjustment</span> and API Imports have been extended to include the new fields.
</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The Shrink metric continues to exist unchanged.</p>
        <p>As both positive and negative values can be entered into the Adjustment and Reduction metric fields, the following is important to note: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Reduction fields are always subtracted, so negative values entered in these fields result in an addition.&#160; </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adjustment fields are always added, so negative values are subtracted.
</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Metrics generated in the main planning view</h4>
        <p>When a given generic Adjustment or Reduction metric is enabled, 29 new metrics are visible for the Adjustment metric and 26 are visible for the Reduction metric in MFP. The difference is due to 3 <span class="Emphasis">Retail Ex Vat</span> metrics being applicable to Adjustment only.</p>
        <p>Aside from <span class="Emphasis">Retail Ex Vat</span>, each of the set of metrics is repeated for <span class="Emphasis">TY</span>,<span class="Emphasis"> LY</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Comparison</span>, in addition to <span class="Emphasis">% +/- LY</span> for Retail and Units.</p>
        <p>A Totals field displays with an aggregate total if two or more Adjustments or  two or more Reductions are enabled. These Total metrics are not plannable.</p>

        <p>Further, actualized values can now be imported via the API import process.  Previously, if a historical period was imported, it would be silently discarded.  Now, if a historical period is provided, it must either be: a) for a master plan, or b) for an Original Plan (OP) branch plan type.  Historical data is not valid for Default typed branches; this data will be discarded with a warning in import logs.  

</p>
        <p>Note that some consideration must be paid between timing API imports and MFP maintenance; if the API import runs and imports actualized data for the last 4 weeks, but then the default MFP maintenance runs for the last 8 weeks, then all of the values imported in the first step will be zeroed out and replaced with whatever values are found in the other standard data feeds (sales history, inventory history, etc).  Some care needs to be taken to set up and sequence imports and maintenance so that the desired plans, metrics, and periods have data maintained by the desired feed.</p>
        <h4>Accounting for Past Due Orders and Stock In Transit</h4>
        <p>Previously, there was no visibility in MFP to owned stock moving between sites. On Order metrics included Past Due orders within the On Order in the current period. However, while Past Due was accounted for it was not visible to users.</p>
        <p>For v2022.1, new metrics provide visibility to Past Due Orders and Stock In Transit allowing for a better understanding of how much stock is owned. DC split metrics are also included in the new On Order Past Due and Stock In Transit metrics.</p>
        <div class="Note_BasicNote">There is a breaking change related to these new metrics. For more information, refer to the Breaking Change section.
		<p>There is a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Include On Order in EOP / BOP</span> related to this functionality. For more information, refer to the System Policies section.</p></div>
        <p>Each of the following metrics has an LY and a Comparison equivalent.</p>

        <h4>Opening multiple copies of the same branch plan </h4>
        <p>It is possible to open multiple copies of the same branch plan. Though this can be desirable for comparisons sake, this can easily cause errors if planners make changes and execute in one version, but then accidentally go back to working in another copy. To prevent such errors, a new warning message displays when users attempt to open a branch plan that is already open. Users can choose to open a new copy or continue working in the existing copy.</p>

        <h3>Reduced allocation cache calculation runs

</h3>
        <p>A new process prevents the allocation cache from recalculating if it meets one of the following criteria:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the location strategy is not set for the strategy.</p>

        <h3>Faster product model recalculations</h3>
        <p>As part of an initiative to reduce the number of redundant calculations scenarios were identified where product models were being recalculated unnecessarily. For TG&#160;JE v2023.3, a new process prevents product models from recalculating if they meet one of the following criteria, the product model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>is in a deleted state</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>is NOT linked to an allocation strategy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>was calculated in the last 36 hours</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">The time duration is governed by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Product Model: Time Interval To Skip a Product Model Calculation</span>. For more information, refer to the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.</p>

        <h3>Preventing the creation and activation of inventories</h3>
        <p>With the introduction of the new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Allow Allocations to Create and/or Activate Inventory</span> users gain the ability to set restrictions that effectively limit the automatic creation and activation of inventories that are associated with Allocation Strategies. The enhancement grants user enhanced flexibility and control, ensuring inventory management aligns more closely with specific business needs and operational preferences.</p>
        <p style="color: #FF0000;" class="Caution">This system policy must be managed with great care. If the system policy is set the <span class="Emphasis">False</span>, then it is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure appropriate inventory management. Improper management can lead to orders not being recommended correctly.</p>
        <h3>Preventing orders from phased-out strategies</h3>
        <p>Resolved issue for clients who produced recommended orders in Allocation Module, if they discontinued the strategy by setting the phase out date to the past. When generating orders in Order Manager, clients will no longer see the recommended orders related to the discontinued Allocation Strategy.</p>
        <p class="Caution">Location Exceptions can define different phase out dates and prevent the Allocation Strategy from being considered discontinued.</p>
        <h3>Selecting sales types when configuring Product Models </h3>
        <p>For customers that use non-standard sales types in the Product Model grid, a new column has been added to the pop-up <span class="Emphasis">Sales Type</span> dialog. This dialog displays when users click the ellipsis in the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Type</span> field. The new column is hidden by default. To display, right-click in the column header fields in the <span class="Emphasis">Excluded</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Included</span> sections and select <span class="Emphasis">Column Chooser</span> from the dropdown menu. </p>

        <p>The use of the R Engine within the Compute Node Manager has been deprecated with the call to get the URL reverting back to the previously existing system policy. The reason is that R Engine as it is used today does not go through the Compute Node Manager. Instead, the R Engine goes through a separate dispatch broker call.

        <h2>Forecasting</h2>
        <h3><a name="2024.1FOC"></a>2024.1</h3>
        <h3>Forecasting cost and retail ticket price </h3>
        <p>Planners can now use two new series, <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Cost</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Retail</span>, to forecast the cost and retail ticket price of selected inventory. The result is insight into the profitability of future sales originally priced in different currencies. The cost and retail of the inventory is calculated using the default cost and retail price of the inventory. Pricing displays in the planner's system or home currency. Currency conversion  is automatic and is defined by existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Currency ID</span> (Engine: Replenish). </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If system policy <span class="Emphasis">Currency ID</span> is set to <span class="Emphasis">1</span>, then currency conversion does not take place.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Demand Forecasting/Currency Metrics.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>The two series appear as color coded lines in the graph with the data being from the currently selected inventory in the Forecast view.</p>
        <p>Currency values are greater than unit values; where 1 unit can correspond to a high currency value (e.g. 1 unit = $100) If both unit and currency forecast data series are selected, the unit values on the graph appear stacked across the bottom of the graph. This is because the y-axis is extended to display the currency values. A best practice is to select either units or currency forecast series when viewing values in the graph. This will apply the appropriate scale to the y-axis for proper viewing. </p>
        <h4>Series Name: Forecast Cost</h4>
        <p>Color: Blue</p>
        <p>Calculation: Forecasted units * cost of the unit in the system currency</p>

        <h3><a name="Using"></a>Using machine learning to improve forecasting</h3>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough v2022.3 introduces a new Forecasting Method labeled Gradient Boosting which is based on machine learning. The machine learning algorithm uses Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to analyze all relevant historical data (known as features) relating to demand patterns (e.g. seasonality, brands), business decisions (e.g. Promotions, changes in display and space), and external factors (e.g. holidays, footfall, weather). The historical data is then translated into an extremely accurate prediction or forecast.</p>
        <p>One major feature of Gradient Boosting is that it is optimized for sparse data. For example, where an item has very low sales but is associated with an item with very high sales. Subtle or obscured connections between features can be uncovered leading to more accurate forecasts and improved sales. Additionally, machine learning requires fewer resources while leveraging all data for each series, is better at aggregate levels and handling Causals, and is easy to scale.</p>
        <p>For more information, ToolsGroup Professional Services can reference <a href="https://toolsgroup-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DMQ/pages/34483109889/LightGBM+Forecasting+documentation">Gradient Boosting</a>.</p>
        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough's implementation of Gradient Boosting is designed for Cloud deployments only. With this Cloud implementation, there is the ability to horizontally scale to shorten calculation times.</p>
        <p>The new Forecast Method <span class="Emphasis">Gradient Boosting</span> displays only for Cloud deployments and is  for Inventory Forecast only since it is at an item site level.</p>
        <h3>High level process flow</h3>
        <p>The Trainer API generates fit models. The Inference API uses the fit models generated by the Trainer API to make a forecast. 

			When users run an inventory forecast, the Forecast API gets any predictions and tournaments them against other statistical forecast methods to determine the best fit. The output forecast method is called <span class="Emphasis">Gradient Boosting</span> in the Forecast viewer. 

		</p>
        <h3>Analysis Installer</h3>
        <p>The introduction of Gradient Boosting required the development of a new Microsoft Installer (MSI) labeled <span class="Emphasis">Analysis Installer</span>. </p>
        <h3>Job Manager tasks</h3>
        <p>Two new Job Manager tasks need to be configured to run the machine learning.</p>

        <h3>Limiting the total number of columns in order documents </h3>
        <p>Order documents have a configured default column count. In addition to the default number of columns, users can add additional columns to their order documents. However, documents may become unusable if there are too many columns. To prevent this, a new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Column Max</span> allows for limiting the total number of columns  that can be included in an order document. </p>
        <p>For example, if <span class="Emphasis">Column Max</span> is set to 100 (the default), then users can have a maximum of 100 columns beyond the default column count.</p>

        <h4>Using custom metrics within order documents </h4>
        <p>New functionality enables the inclusion of custom metrics in order documents. There is a breaking change related to this new functionality. For more information, refer to the Breaking Change section.</p>
        <h4>Merging Variants into a single multi-SKU prepack </h4>
        <p>Prepacks are a combination of related SKUs packaged together. v2022.1 introduces into the Order Manager module a new view labeled <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> that creates prepacks consisting of multiple Variants (style-color). For example, white shirts in large and black shirts in large both in the same prepack.</p>
        <p>Such multi-SKU prepacks containing different style-colors (white and black shirts all at the same size) cannot be created within the Assortment Planning (AP) module as within AP everything is done at the Variant or Placeholder level. In AP, prepacks are created at the Style (6 units, all large white shirts) and Style-Color-Size (4 units, S, M, L, XL white shirts) levels. </p>
        <p>The multi-SKU prepacks in Order Manager are really combinations of Style packs created in AP. The new functionality takes these existing Style packs and combines them into larger prepacks.</p>
        <p>The multiple Variant or multi-SKU prepacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>cannot be smaller than an individual Placeholder packing instruction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>can contain multiple Placeholders, so long as the original packing multiple for each is maintained within the multi-SKU prepack. </p>
                <p>For example, a box with a maximum capacity of 20 units could hold a combination of 4 SKUs that have an order multiple of 5 each. Therefore, the value entered in the <span class="Emphasis">Max Box</span> field must be large enough to accommodate the order multiples for the selected Placeholders. </p>
                <p>Regarding excess space within a box, excess space is not filled if filling the box causes the ratio of Placeholder packs to be out of alignment. The box is not filled in order to hold the alignment among Placeholders in the pack.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>only be generated by combining the initial multiple style-color single size orders, prior to sending the orders to the ERP. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A new macro labeled <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Commitment Rainbow Packs</span> must be executed to display the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span>. The <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> is a prepack combination selection tool that uses user input parameters to search for available Variant order consolidations that would make viable multi-SKU prepacks. The parameters define the desired plan to work with, the product filter for Variants within that plan with delivery dates within the window of time, the window of time, and the maximum units or upper limit for inclusion in a box. </p>
        <p>The multi-SKU&#160;prepacks are grouped by:</p>

                <p> The Style packs created in AP cannot be edited nor the delivery dates shifted within the the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span>. Thus, for orders to be combined, they must have the same receipt date. However, receipt dates can be changed elsewhere within the Order Manager UI. The dates can also be updated by any changes being fed from the ERP. Any changes to date alignment breaks apart any multi-SKU prepacks that are no longer aligned.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">To group Variants as potential multi-SKU prepacks, the <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> may have moved Commitment Variant lines from one order header to another.</p>
        <p>For selected multi-SKU prepacks which should not be created, simply uncheck the check box in the <span class="Emphasis">Selected</span> field in the grid. Once the desired multi-SKU prepacks have been chosen, click the <span class="Emphasis">Process Packs</span> button on the toolbar. The <span class="Emphasis">Rainbow Pack Calculator</span> then uses predefined packing instructions to create multi-SKU prepacks as prepacks within ToolsGroup JustEnough.</p>

        <h4>Asynchronous end batch polling</h4>
        <p>To resolve an issue where long running batch calls are getting cut short due to security timeouts, an end batch asynchronous call has been added which checks if the batching process has completed. </p>
        <p>Unlike the existing end batch synchronous call, the asynchronous call does not keep the port open but immediately returns a status.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The original End Batch functionality which returns a status only when the batching process completes remains unchanged and can be used if so desired. </p>

        <h3>Recalculating an entire price action or price action cluster in one step</h3>
        <p>A new <span class="Emphasis">Refresh Pricing</span> button has been introduced at the Price Action level and the Price Action Cluster level. This new functionality is a quick and convenient way for users to check for and refresh price and cost data and recalculate all items for a Price Action or Price Action Cluster regardless of the calculation status.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Price Planning/Refresh Pricing Button.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Previously, the only way to refresh price and cost data was through time consuming manual changes to trigger a dirty state that led to a calculation refreshing the pricing. 

		</p>
        <p>Now, users can click on the <span class="Emphasis">Refresh Pricing</span> button to check for any new prices and costs related to the Price Action based on the date. Users can display a particular Price Action and refresh the whole Price Action or select and refresh a specific Cluster. The entire Price Action is recalculated whether or not it's been modified. </p>
        <p>Refreshing can be repeated as necessary. 

			For example, should all the prices or costs change later on, the Refresh Pricing functionality can be rerun. All the prices or costs for all of the items and all the Clusters will update and the calculations redone.

        <h3>Viewing detailed information for multiple variants in a single screen</h3>
        <p>Users are no longer required to view or edit variant details one variant at a time. For TG JE v2023.3, the <span class="Emphasis">Detail</span> field was removed as a grid row and a button labeled <span class="Emphasis">Variant Details</span> added to the grid's toolbar. This gives users a much more convenient way to highlight multiple variants and view or edit the details for all those selected in a single screen thus saving time and repetitive clicking.</p>

        <h3>Designating Price Types to be ignored during the Auto Pricing analysis process </h3>
        <p>The existing Auto Pricing functionality allows for the automatic creation of Price Actions using Prices imported through standard import. In scenarios where there are multiple Base Price Types, Administrators can use a new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Auto Pricing Excluded Price Types</span> to designate Price Types to be ignored during the Auto Pricing analysis process.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information on this system policy, refer to the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.</p>

        <h4>Filtering unpriced Variants for new sites</h4>
        <p>A new system policy labeled <span class="Emphasis">Filter unpriced Variants for New Site Pricing</span> now controls whether the <span class="Emphasis">New Site Pricing</span> utility in Site Manager returns all Variants or only those with prices for the selected Price Type (Regular, Promotion, etc.). The default for the new system policy is <span class="Emphasis">False</span> meaning all Variants for the selected price type display. If the system policy is set to <span class="Emphasis">True</span>, then only Variants with a price for the selected price type display.</p>
        <h3><a name="2022.1PM"></a>2022.1</h3>
        <h4>Working with zero priced items in much smaller and manageable Price Actions</h4>
        <p>For new store Price Actions with zero priced items, the zero priced items are now stripped out to separate Price Actions with the suffix <span class="Emphasis">ZP Page-#</span>. This enhancement makes it much easier to deal with zero priced items as these items are all together in much smaller and manageable Price Actions. The number of Variants in each Price Action is limited by the system policy <span class="Emphasis">Auto Generated Price Action Limit</span> (Module: Price Planning).</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Any VariantSites that have no price records are excluded.</p>
        <h4>Searching for columns to add to the Planning grids </h4>
        <p>A search bar has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Customization</span> popup allowing users to search for particular columns to add to the grids in the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> view. The <span class="Emphasis">Customization</span> popup displays when the right-click menu option <span class="Emphasis">Column Chooser</span> is selected.</p>
        <h4>Adding custom views to the Price Manager Planning tab </h4>
        <p>For Variant by Site plans, custom views can now be added as tabs on the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> view. Custom views can be created using a new View Collection Set, View, and Widget (all three are labeled <span class="Emphasis">Price Planner Template</span>). A new stored procedure can be used for reference to build widgets.</p>
        <p>The custom tabs reference the Variant ID from the variant grid.</p>

        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Planner View Collection Set</span> must be set to the View Collection Set ID. When the system policy  is set to a valid View Collection Set ID, then that associated View is visible as a tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Planning</span> view next to the <span class="Emphasis">Site Detail</span> tab. When the system policy isn’t set, the tab is not visible.</p>

        <p>All Min and Max Cost and Price values are aggregated based on the translated value of the Cost and Price of the Variant across all sites in the lower grid. Any Price and Cost values in the lower grid display in the Site’s native currency.</p>
        <h3>Simplified group management for BOGO promotions</h3>
        <p>The way groups are managed in the user interface (UI) for BOGO&#160;AA promotions has been updated to more closely follow the logic of what a BOGO AA&#160;promotion is. The  cleaner more intuitive UI makes it easier and quicker for users to configure the Buy and Get groups. </p>

        <h4>Promotions Planning</h4>
        <p>Introduced with v2021.2, the <span class="Emphasis">Planner</span> tab provides the ability to create and manage Promotion Plans within the Promotions module.  These plans help determine what Variants to promote based on the metrics provided within the filter meta data framework. The Promotions created in the <span class="Emphasis">Planner</span> tab do not display in the List tab until the plan is submitted.</p>
        <p>For v2022.2, the process of working with Promotion Plans has been streamlined to improve usability and the functionality  has been enhanced. Steps requiring users to manually create header records and enter Promotion names have been removed for a simpler in-line process that reduces repetition and saves time.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The changes do not affect Promotions created directly in Promotions Management.</p>

        <h3>Wholesale planning</h3>
        <p>New functionality relating to wholesale planning was introduced for TG&#160;JE v2023.4. For a complete description, see <MadCap:xref href="#2023.WSPL">Wholesale Planning</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Viewing the approximate average stock per choice</h3>
        <p>The following further defines metrics added in TG JE v2023.2. Previously, metrics showed <span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site</span> (S/T% and Min Pres), which are site totals across all choices. These new metrics utilize an additional divisor for <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span>, to provide averages per choice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Avg Approx Stock Units By Choice By Site (S/T %)</span>: Approx Stock Units (S/T%) / TY Plan Site Count / TY Act New Choices</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Edit Target Scenario view work flow improvement</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> toolbar buttons have been reordered to follow a more natural flow through Target planning, and the icons have been changed to have blue icons for in-screen actions and black icons for pop-up-view actions.</p>
        <h3>Making recommendations using Collection level data</h3>
        <p>The existing functionality limited the choice count to using style level information to make recommendations. This functionality has been broadened with a new option to allow the choice count to make recommendations based on collection level information rather than style level information.  To use the new option, select a new checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use Collection For Intra-Style Curve?</span> that has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Create Target Scenario</span> window. Style level information is used if the checkbox is left unchecked. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The default of whether the checkbox is pre-selected or unselected is set using new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Collection For Intra-Style Curve</span> (Module: Target Choice Count). Users can choose to override the default as necessary. </p>
        <p>When changing the property on an existing scenario (that is in Rationalized or Smart Started status), a message displays to inform users that they will need to Rationalize again to update the recommendations based on the new value.</p>
        <h3>Creating floor set updates for varying time frames</h3>
        <p>Target Creation (Assortment Planning or standalone Target Choice Count), provides a connection between MFP plan targets and  an Assortment plan. This tool provides recommended choices, by cluster, using defined parameters. In previous functionality, choice recommendations were made using a defined Window of Time as the selling period for all recommendations. Within that structure (all choices being active during all selected periods), Target Scenarios had to be broken into multiple periods of time to get recommendations for a full season of choices. 

</p>
        <p>To better support the work flow and processes of Assortment planning activities, Target Creation has been enhanced to allow users to define multiple floor set updates with their own windows of time within the selected overall  period of time of a Target Scenario. 

</p>
        <p>An example of this is a scenario with a 6-month window of time representing the Spring assortment, but further broken down into four floor set update periods corresponding to floor sets/product updates. The result being choice recommendations for each of those update periods.

</p>
        <p>To support the continuation of a choice selling across update periods, choices can be merged across update periods. For example, a choice recommendation from update period one, can be connected to a choice recommendation from update period two. This signifies that a single choice carries across periods of time, and one of the recommended choices is fulfilled in each update window.</p>
        <p>The new functionality is made possible with the addition of a new widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Segment Floor Set Updates</span> on the right of the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> view (whether creating a new or copying an existing scenario). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Segment Floor Set Updates.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>As floor set updates are segment-specific, segments must be created first. Therefore, users must click on segments for which updates are to be created and then use the <span class="Emphasis">Segment Floor Set Updates</span> widget to configure the updates. Users have the option to assign the same update to all segments by selecting all segments or configure different updates by segment by clicking on one segment or smaller subsets of segments at a time.</p>
        <p>Fields within the new widget include:</p>

        <h3>Viewing floor set update results

        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Update</span> field has been added to each of the lower tabs in the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> view for scenarios with updates created (Target Worksheet, Target New Choices, and Results Matrix). For example,</p>

            </img>

        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Target Scenario List</span> grid has a new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Updates</span> which lists any configured update periods. </p>
        <h2>Merging placeholder choices</h2>
        <p>Building on the new ability to create floor set updates for varying time frames, planners can merge the choice recommendations for each of those update periods so that styles can continue across multiple updates before phasing out. While planners might define monthly updates which allow for the introduction of newness each month, it is very rare that the entire product offering will be replaced at each of these updates. It is more common that many choices will live through multiple updates, perhaps 3 or 4 monthly updates.</p>
        <p>The choice count recommendations given are initially independent of each other. Meaning update 1 might recommend 6 choices, and update 2 might recommend 8 choices. This can be accomplished by phasing out all 6 choices and introducing 8 new choices OR by merging choices 1-6 from update 1 with choices 1-6 of update 2, resulting in a longer in-phase window for those choices, and allowing for the introduction of two new choices within update 2. The merging function supports this common use case.</p>
        <p>After the merging is done as desired, the combination of the updates by period of time provides a choice count for each. The remaining choice recommendations can be used for newness.</p>
        <p>To view and merge choices, select the new <span class="Emphasis">View Choices By Update</span> toolbar button to display the new <span class="Emphasis">Target Choices By Update</span> view.</p>
        <h3>Target Choices By Update view</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Target Choices By Update</span> view, comprised of four widgets, lets users select which segments and locations to work with.  Check the <span class="Emphasis">Sum Locations</span> check box to sum locations.  When checked, the data displayed collapses to show choices across all selected locations. When unchecked, specific values are broken out for the selected locations.</p>

        <h3>Configuring which clusters and cluster sets get more choices than others</h3>
        <p>To define a nested relationship for assortment choice counts, TG&#160;JE v2023.2 introduces functionality that lets users specify which clusters and cluster sets should always have more choices than others.  The hierarchical configuration can be at the cluster level or at the cluster set level or both, depending on how users create segments and clusters.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Target Creation Cluster Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Select the new <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Config</span> button added to the toolbar to display the <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> screen. Two new screen sections, <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Containment Configuration</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set Containment Configuration</span>, added to this view allow users to specify which clusters and/or cluster sets should always have more choices than others.
</p>
        <p>In the above screen shot,   

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Cluster A</span> will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Cluster B</span>, which will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Cluster C</span>.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span> set will always have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">E-Com Cluster Set</span>, which will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Outlet Cluster Set</span>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If clusters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>are unique across cluster sets (e.g. cluster <span class="Emphasis">E-Com</span> only occurs in <span class="Emphasis">E-Com Cluster Set</span> or cluster <span class="Emphasis">A</span> only occurs in <span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span>), then it is sufficient to use the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Containment Configuration</span> section only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>are not hierarchical in nature (e.g. clusters are Warm Weather versus Cold Weather or East Coast versus West Coast), then use <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set Containment Configuration</span> only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>are repeated in cluster sets, and cluster sets have some hierarchical nature to them (e.g. <span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Outlet Cluster Set</span> both contain <span class="Emphasis">A</span>,<span class="Emphasis"> B</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">C</span> clusters), then use both sections as they can be used jointly.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Using cluster containment configurations in scenarios</h4>
        <p>To use a cluster containment configuration in a scenario, select the checkbox in the new <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> field added to the segment configuration section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Use Cluster Constraint.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>This checkbox can be selected when Target Creation is accessed via the Assortment Planning module, or when in standalone Target Choice Count mode with <span class="Emphasis">Cluster</span> as the specified Site Aggregation Level.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">System policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Cluster Constraint</span> determines whether the <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> field is checked or unchecked when new segments are created or generated.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing a constrained recommended choice count</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> has been added to the Target Worksheet tab. This field shows the recommended choice count after it has been through cluster constraining as configured in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> screen.  If the constrained choice count differs from the recommended choice count, the text is formatted blue.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Constrained Recommended Choice Count.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>If a user changes the choices further (see <span class="Emphasis">TY ACT New Choices</span>), the text is formatted blue if the value is increased and red if the value is decreased.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">User-entered override choice count values are not included by the constrained logic. Cluster constraints are applied against system recommended choice counts. If using user-overrides, all clusters must be revised by the user as desired.</p>
        <h4>Breaking down the constrained recommended choice count by styles and colors</h4>
        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Results Matrix</span> tab displays the output of Rationalization which is the marginal return matrices generated for all segments, cluster sets, and clusters.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To condense the view as above, right-click in the data grid and select the <span class="Emphasis">Best Fit Columns</span> menu option.
</p>
        <p>Whereas the <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> field shows a recommendation of 32 for Cluster A, the <span class="Emphasis">Results Matrix</span> breaks this down allowing users to see that the actual recommendation is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>1 style in 4 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>3 styles each in 3 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>7 styles each in 2 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>5 styles with their own color</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Results Matrix grid formatting</h4>
        <p>The formatting is as follows:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Green background, black text: choices as recommended by the Rationalization process; the count of these cells is consistent with the same-formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Recommended New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Green background, blue text: additional choices as recommended by the Constraint configuration; the count of these cells is consistent with the same formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Blue background, blue text: additional choices as specified by the user; the count of these cells is consistent with the same formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gray background, red text: choices that were recommended by Rationalization and/or Constraint processes, but were removed due to a lower value entered in <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Actual marginal return matrix values</h4>
        <p>

By default, the matrix shows the <span class="Emphasis">Ranking</span> field with its numerical ranking of matrix values.  To view the actual marginal return matrix values, add the <span class="Emphasis">Curve Value</span> field using the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> menu.  The matrix values are used to split the Target value across choices. For example, if this is the matrix for the first style:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix Ratio.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The ratio between matrix values is held in the ratio of TY sales values in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix Ratio New Choices Tab.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Thus, the matrix says that the second color in the collection will have 62.3% of the sales of the first color. In the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab, the ratio between the second choice and first choice is 3,966 / 6,368 = 62.5%.</p>
        <h4>Specifying how collections are created and merged across cluster set / clusters</h4>
        <p>In Segment configuration, users can specify how placeholders are assigned and collections created by selecting a method in the <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> field. For TG JE v2023.2, existing option <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Variants per Collection</span> has been renamed to <span class="Emphasis">Ascending Layering (Legacy)</span>. In addition to the existing 3 options, a new option <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> has been added. If <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> is selected, then collection assignments are merged according to their positions in the marginal return matrices. The result of collection assignments can be viewed in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab.</p>
        <p>Returning later to enable the Cluster Containment functionality by selecting  the <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> checkbox automatically sets the <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> field to <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> when <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> is clicked.</p>
        <p>The default value for <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> is set via new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Collection Option</span>.  However, if a second new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Cluster Constraint</span> is enabled, then the option must be set to <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For definitions and examples relating to the 4 collection options, refer to the TG JE v2023.2 Online Help, <cite>Assortment Planning User Guide</cite>, or <cite>Target Choice Count User Guide</cite>.</p>
        <h4>Using approximate stock quantities to assess recommended choices</h4>
        <p>Within the <span class="Emphasis">Target Worksheet</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> grids, recommended placeholders include Sales $ and Sales U targets. The stock needed to meet those Sales targets is not included in the Target Creation results due to Receipts being calculated later in the Assortment Planning process when other metrics such as Receipt eligible weeks, Presentation Minimums, Allow Receipts after Markdown, etc. are considered.</p>
        <p>However, visibility to an approximate receipt or stock plan would greatly help planners decide whether to proceed with a choice recommendation. For example, planners may have an idea of the number of sizes needed per placeholder as a setup quantity. Depending on the store count within a Cluster Set/Cluster and the number of sizes needed for a presentation, the recommended Sales might not justify buying that choice, because the stock needed to setup is much greater than the Sales potential.</p>
        <p>The target segment configuration section and the Target Worksheet now include the following two user editable metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span>: Target Sales to Total Target Stock</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Min Pres</span>:  The initial value is seeded from Hierarchy Defaults in AP mode. In standalone mode, the values do not seed.  Only Hierarchy Defaults are used. Hierarchy Defaults by Cluster and Hierarchy Defaults by Time are not used.  </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres</span> can be defaulted at the segment level in the segment definitions widget, and both values can be overwritten at the cluster set / cluster level in the Target Worksheet.</p>
        <p>Five new read-only Approximate Stock Unit metrics have been added to the Target Worksheet and Target New Choices grids. The metrics in the Target Worksheet are an aggregate for all new styles while in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> grid, the metrics show values per choice.</p>
        <p>To support differing strategic approaches to target stock levels at different organizations or product levels, there are two sets of metrics added to show approximate stock levels at stores at regular prices for new choices.</p>
        <p>Firstly, approximate stock levels are calculated based solely on sell-through (ST%) targets without concern for maintaining minimum presentation throughout regular price selling periods. In this scenario, saleable stock is gradually depleted by sales throughout the regular price selling period, which may not be an issue where shoppers have lots of choices and are willing to substitute one choice for another. This approach helps avoid having excess inventory at the end of the regular price selling period for all styles. The metrics supporting this logic are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units (S/T %)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units / Target Sell Through %</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site (S/T %)</span>: Approx Stock Units (S/T%) / TY Plan Site Count</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Secondly, approximate stock levels are calculated with the requirements to have enough stock to meet sales and maintain a full minimum presentation throughout the regular price selling period. The metrics supporting this logic are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units + (TY Plan Site Count * Min Pres)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site (Min Pres)</span>: Approx Stock Units (Min Pres) / TY Plan Site Count</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Sales To Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units / Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An approximate stock target based on Sales plus Min Pres does not respond to a defined ST% target. The <span class="Emphasis">Sales To Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span> metric is an Approximate ST% allowing for a comparison of the result of the (Min Pres) calculations to an ST%.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">All 5 metrics are available for use as needed. If some of these metrics are not useful based on the strategy in place, those metrics can be hidden using the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> selector.</p>
        <h3>Improved target planning</h3>
        <p>As part of an effort to expand the usability of the Target Choice Count functionality, four existing read-only metrics within the Target Worksheet are now editable. Although all four metrics are editable and can be selected as visible with the <span class="Emphasis">Field</span> chooser, users can include 1 or more of these metrics within the Target Worksheet while not including the others.</p>
        <p>The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales U % +/- Comparison</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planning against <span class="Emphasis">+/- Comparison</span> supports use cases where the target should be planned against the entire product hierarchy within the Comparison or set the +/- to LY actualized Sales within the cluster set cluster. For example, planning Jeans to LY actualized Sales +20%.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison Active</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales U % +/- Comparison Active</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planning against <span class="Emphasis">+/- Comparison Active</span> supports use cases where the target should be planned against only the Comparison Styles selected for inclusion in Comparison Active or set the +/- to LY actualized Sales for the styles designated for inclusion. For example, planning Core Jeans Styles +20%, rather than the entire hierarchy.</p>
        <p>If one of the <span class="Emphasis">% +/- Comparison Active</span> metrics is edited at the aggregate Cluster Set level, then all <span class="Emphasis">% +/- Comparison Active</span> metrics for Clusters within that Cluster Set will change while holding the relationship between the those Cluster Set/Clusters. A likely more appropriate way to make this change would be at the Cluster Set/Cluster level. This would target specific areas, rather than move the entire Cluster Set. However, changes at the aggregate level are supported and the Cluster relationships will hold.</p>
        <h4>Maintaining AUR</h4>
        <p>Existing logic that AUR is always held is maintained. For example, modifying <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison Active</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>drives a new TY Act New Sales $ value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>updates TY Act New Sales U, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>locks TY Act New AUR.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improved control over one-off and poor performing variants</h3>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.2, the functionality associated with data cleansing in AP&#160;and Target Choice Count has been expanded with the addition of a new threshold and new fields that give users more control over one-off variants and habitual poor performers. </p>
        <p> The new data cleansing threshold, <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span>, lets users identify and remove consistently low sellers from the cleansing process. As with the other existing thresholds the default is set using a system policy. In this case, new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Cleanse: Active Variant Total Minimum</span> (Module: Target Choice Count). The default is used when segments are created. However, users can change the value at the segment level.</p>
        <p>
                        The <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span> functionality:
                        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>finds the total cleansed Active sales for all variants in the segment / cluster set / cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>finds the average of these totals</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>multiplies the threshold to the average total to get the Minimum required</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>excludes any variants whose total is lower than this Minimum</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">View Data Cleansing Report</span> toolbar button displays the <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing</span> report. The <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing Settings</span> section displays the data cleansing parameters or thresholds, now including <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span>, that are used for each segment. The background color of the threshold fields corresponds to data points that were cleansed or altered as a result of each.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Target Data Cleansing Settings.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>For ease of use, all coloring rules used in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing</span> report have been modified to purple to be more streamlined. This makes it easier to cross reference the background color of the threshold fields against the data points that were cleansed or altered as a result of each.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Choosing whether to rationalize placeholders</h4>
        <p>A new read-only checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Carryover</span> allows users to decide whether to include or exclude given placeholders from processing. If an item is to be carried over, but is near the end of its life and thus has a minimal sales plan in the current time period, then users can include the item so that Rationalization is informed by the item’s performance and recommends new placeholders to take its place. If the item is a carryover but it is expected to continue to sell with the same volume as last year, then the item can be excluded because its plan is already created and accounted for.
			</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Active Variant Total Minimum.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The method for population of the <span class="Emphasis">Carryover</span> field depends on whether Target Creation is accessed through AP or standalone Target Choice Count:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In AP, Carryover is based on whether the placeholder’s phase dates intersect both the scenario Window of Time and the Comparison time period. For example, if the Comparison time period is over 2022 week 1 - week 10, and the scenario is over 2023 week 1 - week 10, an item selling from 2022 week 5 to 2023 week 15 will be considered carryover, but an item that phases out in 2022 week 30 is not.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In standalone Target Choice Count, Carryover is calculated with the same logic as in AP, but uses Inventory level phase dates instead of placeholder phase dates. If at least one of the variant’s inventories' phase dates intersect both Window of Time and Comparison time frames, then the variant is considered carryover.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Excluding placeholders from rationalization post data cleansing</h4>
        <p>A new editable field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Inclusion Type</span> gives users the ability, even after data cleansing,  to manually exclude some placeholders from consideration in the rationalization process. For example, a placeholder was a very unique item whose trends are not expected to be repeated in the future. The default setting is <span class="Emphasis">Full Process</span>.</p>

        <h3>Using an additional attribute/group level to further align key strategies</h3>
        <p>Within Target Creation (and Target Choice Count),  the addition of an optional <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field that interacts with the <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> functionality means the <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> function can now apply down to an additional attribute/group level. This can be very helpful when creating targets which align to key strategies, such as: by brand, fashion, marketing program, or any product attribute as defined.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Segment Split Type Field.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field is available as a dropdown when creating or modifying target scenarios with the dropdown comprised of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Variant Hierarchy fields (but only those not a part of the configured Product Hierarchy)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Variant (for standalone TCC) or Placeholder (for AP) attribute fields - (only LOOKUP attribute types)</p>
                <p>When creating targets in AP, the entity in use is Placeholder (not Variant). There is no explicit assignment of hierarchy groups to Placeholders. Thus, if a Group type is chosen such as Brand, then the application will look up the Group value of the assigned variant. If there is no assigned variant, then the Lookup value is <span class="Emphasis">None</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">The option <span class="Emphasis">(None)</span> is intended to be used to clear previously selected options.  </p>
        <p>If no attribute is selected, then <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> works the same as it did previously. It creates one segment for each of the lowest hierarchy levels of the Product Hierarchy selection. If an attribute is chosen, then segments are created on a cross section of hierarchy levels and the attribute selected. For example, if <span class="Emphasis">Brand</span> is chosen, then the segments are the combinations of product hierarchy levels and brands.</p>
        <h4>Segment names and descriptions</h4>
        <p>If segments are generated with an attribute selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field, then a column automatically displays with the selected attribute name as the column header, with the individual values shown in the column contents.</p>
        <p>When segments are generated via <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span>, the automatically generated segment names and descriptions are <span class="Emphasis">&lt;product hierarchy code&gt; / &lt;split type code&gt;</span> and <span class="Emphasis">&lt;product hierarchy description&gt; / &lt;split type description&gt;</span>.</p>

This is to reflect that the view has been updated to  display all placeholders / variants included in a scenario, and now shows the listed segments to which each placeholder is assigned. </p>

        <p>The use of the R Engine within the Compute Node Manager has been deprecated with the call to get the URL reverting back to the previously existing system policy. The reason is that R Engine as it is used today does not go through the Compute Node Manager. Instead, the R Engine goes through a separate dispatch broker call. The system policy, labeled <span class="Emphasis">The RScript Service URL</span> (Module: Allocation), was previously hidden but is now visible.

        <h3>Selective creation of site (store)-level MFP plans</h3>
        <p>When creating plans in MFP, users can decide which levels of the location hierarchy should be included in the plan. In general, the recommendation is to not plan at the lowest level (aka Store or Site) as that level of granularity is generally not needed. Also, if the plan is established at the site-level, all MFP data must be stored at that level. This results in large amounts of data to be saved and reduced performance within MFP.</p>
        <p>However, MFP plans can be created at the site-level, if the user desires. With data requirements and performance speed in mind, focused store plans should only be created for specific (limited) sites.</p>
        <h3>Using sites (store)-level MFP plans to create site clusters</h3>
        <p>If a focused site-level store plan has been created, those site-level planned attributes can be used within Site Clustering, specifically Sales Units or Sales Revenue. This allows the machine-learning algorithms within Site Clustering to reference site-level planned data to create clusters. Creating site clusters based on site-level planned data supports clustering based on <i>planned</i> MFP-site performance, rather than <i>historical</i> site performance.</p>
        <p> Select new Attribute Type <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Attribute</span>, via either the <span class="Emphasis">Add Attribute</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Edit Attribute</span> dialogs, to specify a site-level MFP plan as a sales attribute and a time range to be used in conjunction to cluster sites with. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The hybrid MFP plans listed are those plans that are in status <span class="Emphasis">Initialized</span>, <span class="Emphasis">In Progress</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Authorized</span>. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The hybrid MFP plans must have the exactly the same product hierarchy levels down to the selected clustering level. These plans can have lower levels of the product hierarchy as well but can’t be at a higher level than the required clustering. Time range selections need to be within the time range of the financial plan.</p>

        <h4>Configuring and using Sub-Clusters</h4>
        <p>New functionality allows for the configuring of Sub-Clusters in the Site Clustering module which are then assigned Placeholders and Collections in the Assortment Planning module. Sub-Clusters allow users to make adjustments to phase periods by a site attribute such as climate.</p>
        <p>Sub-Clustering is especially useful in scenarios where there is a seasonal product that does not begin selling in certain climates until a different phase date.  For example, cold weather stores will not have a strong demand for swimsuits until 6-8 weeks later than hot weather stores.</p>

        <h4>Calculating lost sales for web stores without SOH </h4>
        <p>Lost sales for both physical and web-based stores that maintain their own stock on hand (SOH) is calculated using the store's SOH.
