        <h1>Custom Prescription Definition</h1>
        <h2>Optionality</h2>
        <p>If the Inventory Solution is used <span class="EmphasisItalic">out of the box</span>, there will be no need for any custom prescription because there will be no custom Inventory artifacts to act upon.</p>
        <h2>Core Prescription Retrieval Query</h2>
        <p>It is strongly recommended that the following query be executed, the results studied, and the capabilities for reuse of ID Lists noted.  The <span class="Emphasis">StepObjective</span> clearly states what each step will do, and the artifacts concerned, with the sole exception of the Procedural Delete, where the tables involved are too numerous, typically, to enumerate.</p>
