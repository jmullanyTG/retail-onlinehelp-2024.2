        <h1>Custom Procedural Code</h1>
        <p>Inventory Purge supports the execution of custom code for one or more custom steps of type ID 5.</p>
        <p>A wrapper-stub procedure is provided within the <code>Inventory_C</code> DB schema.  We strongly recommend using a wrapper-calls-custom-code coding paradigm to encapsulate custom code under near-identical-looking wrapper procedures.  This is how the core Purge process is architected when executing pre-existing core code procedures.  We do not restrict customization to using this approach -- there may be valid cases where the custom code need only be added to a clone of the wrapper-stub.</p>
        <h2>Suggested Custom Procedure Development Approach</h2>
        <p>The approach is very similar to that described above for the Custom INIT procedure – copy, rename (removing _STUB), ensure the SET statement is present, then customize.</p>
        <p>The sample handles step-completion logging to the <code>Inventory.PurgeLog</code> table.</p>
        <p>All <code>Inventory.PurgeBatch</code> and <code>Inventory.PurgeBatch_Step</code> progress updates are performed by core code.</p>
        <p>Under NO circumstances are ANY UPDATE DML statements to be issued against ANY core table – they are unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Core code procedures already coded in the STUB are the only procedures within the <code>Inventory.Purge</code> space that may be executed.</p>
        <p>Note the comment block in the wrapper STUB:</p>

** When calling the Custom Procedure itself, the signature is the same as for
** this stub IF ANY LOGGING IS TO OCCUR FOR EXCEPTIONS/INFORMATIONAL CONTENT.
** ========================================================================== */</MadCap:codeSnippetBody>
        </MadCap:codeSnippet>
        <p>Using the same signature enables calls to the <code>Inventory.Purge_LogActivity</code> procedure to be made within the procedure called by the wrapper.</p>
        <p>Using the core code’s wrapper and called procedures for educational purposes is highly recommended.</p>
